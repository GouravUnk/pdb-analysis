    "abstract": "To progress the RNA-binding small molecule drug discovery, the specific interaction between RNAs having a single bulge and a fluoroquinolone derivative, KG022, was analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. In our previous work, it was found that KG022 is located between the two base pairs at the 3' and 5' side of the bulged residue. KG022 prefers G or C as the bulged residue and, in the present study, the reason for this preference was analyzed by using RNAs with modified nucleoside residues as the bulged residue. It was found that the amino groups of bulged guanine and cytidine bases interact with the oxygen atoms of the backbone phosphate groups, and the oxygen and nitrogen atoms of bulged guanine and cytidine bases interact with the piperazine group of KG022. Thus, this work presents an example of the mechanism of the specific recognition of a small molecule by RNAs.",

    "abstract": "These studies reveal the first structure of Clostridium acetobutylicum alcohol dehydrogenase (CaADH), a protein exhibiting remarkable substrate promiscuity and stereochemical fidelity. The CaADH enzyme is utilized here for synthesizing 20 potential aryl isoserine side chains for the Taxotere family of tubulin-binding chemotherapeutics. The approach involves dynamic reductive kinetic resolution (DYRKR) upon the corresponding \u03b1-chloro-\u03b2-keto esters, showing high D-syn stereoselectivity, including those leading to the clinically relevant milataxel (Ar\u00a0=\u00a02-furyl) and simotaxel (Ar\u00a0=\u00a02-thienyl) side chains. Furthermore, various cross-coupling chemistries performed on the p-bromophenyl isoserine side chain significantly enhance the structural diversity of the taxoid side chain library obtained (16 additional taxoid side chains). The CaADH structure is notable: (i) the nicotinamide cofactor is bound in an anti-conformation, with the amide carbonyl occupying the ketone binding pocket, and (ii) a flexible loop near the active site likely contributes to the remarkable substrate promiscuity observed in CaADH. We present our perspective on the dynamic nature of the CaADH active site through molecular dynamics simulation, proposing a halogen bonding model as a potential mechanism for the remarkable selectivity for an (S)-configured C\u2500Cl bond, in addition to the D-facial selectivity, demonstrated across 20 diverse substrates by this remarkable short-chain dehydrogenase enzyme.",

    "abstract": "A cure for chronic hepatitis B requires eliminating or permanently silencing covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). A pivotal target of this approach is the hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein (HBx), which is a key factor that promotes transcription from cccDNA. However, the HBx structure remains unsolved. Here, we present the cryoelectron microscopy structure of HBx in complex with DDB1, which is an essential complex for cccDNA transcription. In this structure, hydrophobic interactions within HBx were identified, and mutational analysis highlighted their importance in the HBV life cycle. Our biochemical analysis revealed that the HBx-DDB1 complex directly interacts simultaneously with NSE3, which is a component of the SMC5/6 complex, and Spindlin1. Additionally, HBx-DDB1 complex dynamics were explored via high-speed atomic force microscopy. These findings provide comprehensive insights into the structure and function of HBx in HBV replication.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial contractile injection systems (CIS) are phage tail-like macromolecular complexes that mediate cell-cell interactions by injecting effector proteins into target cells. CIS from <i>Streptomyces coelicolor</i> (CIS<sup>Sc</sup>) are localized in the cytoplasm. Under stress, they induce cell death and impact the <i>Streptomyces</i> life cycle. It remains unknown, however, whether CIS<sup>Sc</sup> require accessory proteins to directly interact with the cytoplasmic membrane to function. Here, we characterize the putative membrane adaptor CisA, a conserved factor in CIS gene clusters across <i>Streptomyces</i> species. We show by cryo-electron tomography imaging and in vivo assays that CIS<sup>Sc</sup> contraction and function depend on CisA. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we provide an atomic model of the extended CIS<sup>Sc</sup> apparatus; however, CisA is not part of the complex. Instead, our findings show that CisA is a membrane protein with a cytoplasmic N-terminus predicted to interact with CIS<sup>Sc</sup> components, thereby providing a possible mechanism for mediating CIS<sup>Sc</sup> recruitment to the membrane and subsequent firing. Our work shows that CIS function in multicellular bacteria is distinct from type VI secretion systems and extracellular CIS, and possibly evolved due to the role CIS<sup>Sc</sup> play in regulated cell death.",

Benchmarking HX-ESP by fitting two ligands to PAK1 and four ligands to MAP4K1 (HPK1) and comparing the results to X-ray crystallography structures, demonstrates that HX-ESP can identify binding modes across a range of affinities significantly outperforming flexible docking for ligands necessitating large conformational adjustments. By objectively guiding simulations with experimental HX data, HX-ESP overcomes the long time scales required for binding predictions using traditional MD. This advancement enhances the accuracy of computational modeling in drug discovery and thus will accelerate the development of effective therapeutics.",

The cellular uptake of taurine is primarily mediated by the taurine transporter (TauT), and its dysfunction leads to retinal regeneration, cardiomyopathy, neurological and aging-associated disorders. Here we determine structures of TauT in two states: the apo inward-facing open state and the occluded state bound with substrate taurine or \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In addition to monomer, the structures also reveal a TauT dimer, where two cholesterol molecules act as \"molecular glue\", and close contacts of two TM5 from each protomer mediate the dimer interface. In combination with functional characterizations, our results elucidate the detailed mechanisms of substrate recognition, specificity and transport by TauT, providing a structural framework for understanding TauT function and exploring potential therapeutic strategies for taurine-deficiency-related disorders.",

    "abstract": "AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate the majority of excitatory neurotransmission in the brain<sup>1</sup>. Assembled from combinations of four core subunits, GluA1-4, and ~20 auxiliary subunits, their molecular diversity tunes information transfer and storage in a brain circuit-specific manner. GluA3, a subtype strongly associated with disease<sup>2</sup>, functions as both a fast transmitting Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable (CP) AMPAR at sensory synapses<sup>3</sup>, and as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-impermeable (CI) receptor at cortical synapses<sup>4,5</sup>. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of the CP GluA3 homomer, which substantially diverge from other AMPARs. The GluA3 extracellular domain tiers (NTD and LBD) are closely coupled throughout gating states, creating previously unseen interfaces that impact signalling and harbour human disease mutations. Central to this architecture is a stacking interaction between two arginine residues (Arg163) in the NTD dimer interface, trapping a unique NTD dimer conformation that enables close contacts with the LBD. Rupture of the Arg163 stack not only alters the structure and dynamics of the GluA3 extracellular region, but also increases receptor trafficking, and the expression of GluA3 heteromers at the synapse. We further show that a mammalian-specific GluA3 trafficking checkpoint determines conformational stability of the LBD tier. Hence, specific design features define communication and biogenesis of GluA3, offering a framework to interrogate this disease-prone glutamate receptor.",

    "abstract": "\u03b13\u03b2 glycine receptor (GlyR) is a subtype of GlyRs that belongs to the Cys-loop receptor superfamily. It is highly expressed in the spinal dorsal horn where sensory information is integrated. Under inflammatory conditions, the large unstructured intracellular M3/M4 loops of the \u03b13 subunit are phosphorylated through the prostaglandin E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>) pathway, inhibiting ion conduction, and resulting in elevated pain sensation. A small molecule analgesic analog, 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol (2,6-DTBP) potentiates phosphorylated \u03b13\u03b2 GlyR through unclear mechanisms and relieves pain. Combining cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) structures and single molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments, we show compaction of M3/M4 loop towards the ion conduction pore upon phosphorylation and further by 2,6-DTBP binding, which in turn modulates function through changing pore conformations and local electrostatics. We show that simultaneous interactions with the\u00a0M3/M4 loop and the transmembrane domain (TM) is necessary for the potentiation of heteromeric \u03b13\u03b2 GlyR by 2,6-DTBP,\u00a0while TM interaction alone is sufficient to potentiate homomeric \u03b13 GlyR, explaining the mystery of why 2,6-DTBP potentiates only phosphorylated \u03b13\u03b2 GlyR. These findings show how post-translational modification of the unstructured intracellular M3/M4 loop may regulate Cys-loop receptor function, providing new perspectives in pain control and other pharmaceutical development targeting GlyRs and other Cys-loop receptors.",

    "abstract": "RNA polymerase III (Pol III) transcribes highly demanded RNAs grouped into three types of classical promoters, including type 1 (5S rRNA), type 2 (tRNA) and type 3 (short non-coding RNAs, such as U6, 7SK and RNase H1) promoters<sup>1-7</sup>. While structures of the Pol III preinitiation complex (PIC)<sup>8-11</sup> and elongation complex (EC)<sup>12-16</sup> have been determined, the mechanism underlying the transition from initiation to elongation remains unclear. Here we reconstituted seven human Pol III transcribing complexes (TC4, TC5, TC6, TC8, TC10, TC12 and TC13) halted on U6 promoters with nascent RNAs of 4-13 nucleotides. Cryo-electron microscopy structures captured initially transcribing complexes (ITCs; TC4 and TC5) and ECs (TC6-13). Together with KMnO<sub>4</sub> footprinting, the data reveal extensive modular rearrangements: the transcription bubble expands from PIC to TC5, followed by general transcription factor (GTF) dissociation and abrupt bubble collapse from TC5 to TC6, marking the ITC-EC transition. In TC5, SNAPc and TFIIIB remain bound to the promoter and Pol III, while the RNA-DNA hybrid adopts a tilted conformation with template DNA blocked by BRF2, a TFIIIB subunit. Hybrid forward translocation during ITC-EC transition triggers BRF2-finger retraction, GTF release and transcription-bubble collapse. Pol III then escapes the promoter while GTFs stay bound upstream, potentially enabling reinitiation. These findings reveal molecular insights into Pol III dynamics and reinitiation mechanisms on type 3 promoters of highly demanded small RNAs, with the earliest documented initiation-elongation transition for an RNA polymerase.",

    "abstract": "The replicative helicase-catalyzed unwinding of the DNA double helix is the initiation of DNA replication. Helicases and primases are functionally related enzymes that have even been expressed as fusion proteins in some organisms and viruses. However, the mechanism underlying DNA unwinding initiation by these helicase-primase fusion enzymes and the functional association between domains have not been elucidated. Herein, we report the cryo-EM structures of mpox virus E5, the founding member of these helicase-primase enzymes, in various enzymatic stages. Notably, E5 forms a head-to-head double hexamer encircling dsDNA, disrupted by the conformational rearrangement of primase domains upon nucleotide incorporation. Five E5-ssDNA-ATP structures further support an ATP cycle-driven non-classical escort model for E5 translocation. Finally, the helicase domain is found to enhance the primase function as a DNA scaffold. Together, our data shed light on the E5-mediated DNA unwinding model including dsDNA loading, DNA melting, ssDNA translocation, and provide a reasonable interpretation for evolutionary preservation of helicase-primase fusion from a functional perspective.",

Here, we report cryo-EM structures of GD-BatCoV (BtCoV-422) and SE-PangolinCoV (MjHKU4r-CoV-1) RBDs in complex with human DPP4 (hDPP4). These structures exhibit a substantial offset in their hDPP4 interaction interfaces, revealing a conserved hydrophobic cluster as a convergent signature of DPP4 binding within the MERS-HKU4 clade of merbecoviruses. Structure-guided mutagenesis demonstrates that favorable interactions are distributed across multiple receptor binding motif (RBM) regions, working synergistically to confer high-affinity hDPP4 binding. Swapping of the merbecovirus RBM regions indicate limited plasticity and interchangeability among these regions. In addition, we report cryo-EM structures of six merbecovirus S-trimers. Structure-based phylogenetics suggests that hDPP4-binding merbecoviruses undergo convergent evolution, while ACE2-binding merbecoviruses exhibit diversification in their binding mechanisms. These findings offer critical insights into merbecovirus receptor utilization, providing a structural understanding for future surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Rhodopsins are light-sensitive membrane proteins capturing solar energy via a retinal cofactor covalently attached to a lysine residue. Several groups of rhodopsins lack the conserved lysine and showed no retinal binding. Recently, flotillin-associated rhodopsins (FArhodopsins or FARs) were identified and suggested to lack the retinal-binding pocket despite preserving the lysine residue in many members of the group. Here, we present cryoelectron microscopic (cryo-EM) structures of paralog FArhodopsin and proteorhodopsin from marine bacterium Pseudothioglobus, both forming pentamers similar to those of other microbial rhodopsins. We demonstrate no binding of retinal to the FArhodopsin despite preservation of the lysine residue and overall similarity of the protein fold and internal organization to those of the retinal-binding paralog. Mutational analysis confirmed that two amino acids, H84 and E120, prevent retinal binding within the FArhodopsin. Our work provides insights into the natural retinal loss in microbial rhodopsins and might contribute to the further understanding of FArhodopsins.",

    "abstract": "The ability of coronaviruses to recombine and cross species barriers affects human and animal health globally and is a pandemic threat<sup>1,2</sup>. FCoV-23 is a recently emerged, highly pathogenic recombinant coronavirus responsible for a widespread outbreak of feline infectious peritonitis. Here we report cryogenic electron microscopy structures of two FCoV-23 spike isoforms that correspond to the in-host loss of domain\u20090 observed in clinical samples. The loss of domain\u20090 markedly enhances the fusogenicity and kinetics of entry into cells and possibly enables biotype switching and lethality. We show that FCoV-23 can use several aminopeptidase\u2009N orthologues as receptors and reveal the molecular determinants of receptor species tropism, including a glycan that modulates human receptor engagement. We define antigenic relationships among alphacoronaviruses that infect humans and other mammalian species and identify a cross-reactive alphacoronavirus monoclonal antibody that inhibits FCoV-23 entry. Our results pave the way for the development of vaccines and therapeutics that target this highly pathogenic virus.",

    "abstract": "Human immunoglobulin A (IgA), comprising the isotypes IgA1 and IgA2, protects ~400 m2 of mucosal surfaces against microbial infections but can also lead to aberrant IgA deposits that cause disease. Certain bacteria have evolved peptidases that cleave the hinge between the Fab and Fc fragments of IgA, undermining its immune function. These peptidases specifically target IgA1, but not IgA2, which predominates in the gut and possesses a structurally distinct hinge region. The only known IgA2-specific peptidase is IgAse from the gut microbiome member Thomasclavelia ramosa, which also targets IgA1 but no other proteins. IgAse is a\u2009~\u2009140-kDa, seven-domain, membrane-bound metallopeptidase (MP). Differential scanning fluorimetry, small-angle X-ray scattering, AI-based structural predictions, mass spectrometry, and high-resolution crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy of multidomain fragments of IgAse revealed a novel 313-residue catalytic domain (CD) from the igalysin family within the metzincin MP clan. The CD is flanked by an N-terminal globular C-type lectin-like domain and a wrapping domain (WD), followed by four all-\u03b2 domains. Functional studies involving a comprehensive set of constructs (wild-type and mutant), authentic and recombinant IgA fragments, and inhibitors demonstrated that the minimal functional assembly requires the CD and WD, along with the Fab and hinge region (Fab'). Modelling studies suggested that the Fab heavy-chain constant domain interacts with the N-terminal subdomain of the CD, positioning the hinge peptide for cleavage-a mechanism confirmed by mutational analysis. These findings open avenues for therapeutic strategies to inhibit the only known IgA1/IgA2 peptidase and to develop it for dissolving pathologic IgA deposits.",

Here we report crystal structures of the chromophore-binding module of soybean phytochrome A, including ~2.2\u2009\u00c5 XFEL structures of Pr and Pfr at ambient temperature and high resolution cryogenic structures of Pr. In the Pfr structure, the chromophore is exposed to the medium, the D-ring remaining \u03b1-facial following the likely clockwise photoflip. The chromophore shifts within its pocket, while its propionate side chains, their partners as well as three neighbouring tyrosines shift radically. Helices near the chromophore show substantial shifts that might represent components of the light signal. These changes reflect those in bacteriophytochromes despite their quite different signalling mechanisms, implying that fundamental aspects of phytochrome photoactivation have been repurposed for photoregulation in the eukaryotic plant.",

The crystal structure of KpAmy13 was determined at a resolution of 1.9 \u00c5, revealing the structures of all its domains: N, A, B, and C. Domain N resembles the starch-binding domain known as carbohydrate-binding module family 69, found in \u03b1-glucan-related proteins. Although domain N does not conserve the starch-binding residues observed in other proteins, it has several hydrophobic residues on its surface, which might be involved in promoting catalysis. The catalytic cleft is located at the bottom of a circular depression. The domain N-truncated mutant of KpAmy13 in complex with maltohexaose showed that its non-reducing end glucose docks at subsite -6. The long and complex structure of domain B contributes to forming a cleft of the right size for six glucose moieties, demonstrating the exo-acting mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) proteins are immune sensors for double-stranded RNA and are critical for restricting viruses. OAS2 comprises two OAS domains, only one of which can synthesize 2'-5'-oligoadenylates for RNase L activation. Existing structures of OAS1 provide a model for enzyme activation, but they do not explain how multiple OAS domains discriminate RNA length. Here, we discover that human OAS2 exists in an auto-inhibited state as a zinc-mediated dimer and present a mechanism for RNA length discrimination: the catalytically deficient domain acts as a molecular ruler that prevents autoreactivity to short RNAs. We demonstrate that dimerization and myristoylation localize OAS2 to Golgi membranes and that this is required for OAS2 activation and the restriction of viruses that exploit the endomembrane system for replication, e.g., coronaviruses. Finally, our results highlight the non-redundant role of OAS proteins and emphasize the clinical relevance of OAS2 by identifying a patient with a loss-of-function mutation associated with autoimmune disease.",

    "abstract": "The ultimate potential of B cells imprinted by ancestral SARS-CoV-2 in developing neutralizing breadth and potency remains to be explored. Here, we longitudinally tracked B cells that recognize the wild-type spike in two individuals who were repeatedly infected by Omicron variants after receiving prototype mRNA vaccines. Functional and genetic analysis of 632 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from those B cells reveals that mAbs cloned after a second infection have dramatically enhanced neutralizing breadth and potency due to immune recalls. Among the eleven mAbs that broadly neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants from the wild type to KP.3, five mAbs are classified into public clonotypes encoded by IGHV3-53 or IGHV3-66, whereas the rest belong to a rare clonotype encoded by IGHV3-74. Notably, IGHV3-74 mAbs can also potently neutralize other sarbecoviruses by targeting a non-dominant epitope partially overlapping with receptor-binding domain (RBD)-3 and RBD-5. These results support that ancestral SARS-CoV-2 immune imprinting can be harnessed in developing pan-SARS-CoV-2 and even cross-sarbecovirus vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Three capsid types have been recognized from the nuclei of herpesvirus-infected cells: empty A-capsids, scaffolding-containing B-capsids, and DNA-filled C-capsids. Despite progress in determining atomic structures of these capsids and extracellular virions in recent years, debate persists concerning the origins and temporal relationships among these capsids during capsid assembly and genome packaging. Here, we have imaged over 300,000 capsids of herpes simplex virus type 1 by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) and exhaustively classified them to characterize the structural heterogeneity of the DNA-translocating portal complex and their functional states. The resultant atomic structures reveal not only the expected A-, B-, and C-capsids but also capsids with portal vertices similar to C-capsids but no resolvable genome in the capsid lumen, which we named D-capsids. The dodecameric dsDNA-translocating portal complex varies across these capsid types in their radial positions in icosahedral capsids and exhibits structural dynamics within each capsid type. In D-capsids, terminal DNA density exists in multiple conformations including one reminiscent of that in C-capsids, suggesting D-capsids are products of failed DNA retention. This interpretation is supported by varying amounts of DNA outside individual D-capsids and by the correlation of capsid counts observed <i>in situ</i> of infected cell nuclei and those after purification. Additionally, an \"anchoring\" segment of the scaffold protein is resolved interacting with the portal baskets of A- and B-capsids but not D- and C-capsids. Taken together, our data indicate that A-capsids arise from failed DNA packaging and D-capsids from failed genome retention, clarifying the origins of empty capsids in herpesvirus assembly.IMPORTANCEAs the prototypical herpesvirus, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) exhibits a global seroprevalence of 67% and approaching 90% in some localities. Herpesvirus infections can cause devastating cancers and birth defects, with HSV-1 infections leading to cold sores among the general population worldwide and blindness in developing nations. Here, we present atomic structures of the capsids sorted out from the nuclear isolates of HSV-1 infected cells, including the previously recognized A-, B-, and C-capsids, as well as the newly identified D-capsid. The structures show the details of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions within each capsid type and the positional and interactional variability of the viral DNA-translocating portal vertex among these capsids. Importantly, our findings suggest that A-capsids are products of failed dsDNA packaging and D-capsids of failed genome retention. Together, the high-resolution 3D structures clarify the processes of genome packaging, maintenance, and ejection during capsid assembly, which are conserved across all herpesviruses.",

    "abstract": "The apicomplexan mitochondrial electron transport chain is essential for parasite survival and displays a divergent subunit composition. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of an apicomplexan III<sub>2</sub>-IV supercomplex and of the drug target complex III<sub>2</sub>. The supercomplex structure reveals how clade-specific subunits form an apicomplexan-conserved III<sub>2</sub>-IV interface with a unique, kinked architecture, suggesting that supercomplexes evolved independently in different eukaryotic lineages. A knockout resulting in supercomplex disassembly challenges the proposed role of III<sub>2</sub>-IV in electron transfer efficiency as suggested for mammals. Nevertheless, knockout analysis indicates that III<sub>2</sub>-IV is critical for parasite fitness. The complexes from the model parasite Toxoplasma gondii were inhibited with the antimalarial atovaquone, revealing interactions underpinning species specificity. They were also inhibited with endochin-like quinolone (ELQ)-300, an inhibitor in late-stage preclinical development. Notably, in the apicomplexan binding site, ELQ-300 is flipped compared with related compounds in the mammalian enzyme. On the basis of the binding modes and parasite-specific interactions discovered, we designed more potent ELQs with subnanomolar activity against T.\u2009gondii. Our findings reveal critical evolutionary differences in the role of supercomplexes in mitochondrial biology and provide insight into cytochrome b inhibition, informing future drug discovery.",

Decreased AmpG function reduces resistance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. Therefore, AmpG-targeting inhibitors are promising 'antibiotic adjuvants'. However, as the tertiary structure of AmpG has not yet been identified, the development of targeted inhibitors remains challenging. We present four cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures: the apo-inward and apo-outward state structures and the inward-occluded and outward states complexed with the substrate GlcNAc-1,6-anhMurNAc. Through functional analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified motif A, which stabilizes the outward state, substrate-binding pocket, and protonation-related residues. Based on the structure of AmpG and our experimental results, we propose a muropeptide transport mechanism for AmpG. A deeper understanding of its structure and transport mechanism provides a foundation for the development of antibiotic adjuvants.",

BK displays shallow voltage sensitivity with very fast gating charge kinetics, yet little is known about the molecular underpinnings of this distinctive behavior. Here, we explore the mechanistic basis of coupling between voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) and calcium sensors in Aplysia BK by locking the VSDs in their activated (R196Q and R199Q) and resting (R202Q) states, with or without calcium. Cryo-EM structures of these mutants reveal unique tilts at the S4 C-terminal end, together with large side-chain rotameric excursions of the gating charges. Notably, the VSD resting structure (R202Q) also revealed BK in its elusive, fully closed state, highlighting the reciprocal relation between calcium and voltage sensors. These structures provide a plausible path where voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding couple energetically and define the conformation of the pore domain and, thus, BK's full functional range.",

    "abstract": "<h4>Purpose</h4>Commonly occurring oncogenic mutations in EGFR render non-small cell lung cancers sensitive to approved EGFR-targeted drugs. EGFR in-frame exon 20 insertion (ex20ins) mutants are, however, less sensitive to such drugs. The efficacy of existing medicines may in part be limited by their selectivity for ex20ins mutations relative to wild-type EGFR, which is important for epithelial tissue homeostasis.<h4>Experimental design</h4>We solved high-resolution crystal structures of clinically frequent ex20ins mutants to better understand how to achieve mutant-selective inhibition. Analyses of these structures demonstrate targetable ex20ins-mutant-biased dynamic protein states. To exploit these findings, we designed STX-721, an irreversible EGFR/ERBB2 ex20ins-mutant-selective inhibitor, and characterized its activity relative to clinical phase benchmarks across multiple preclinical assays.<h4>Results</h4>Structural analyses predict that STX-721 takes advantage of ex20ins-mutant-selective dynamic states. In carefully benchmarked biochemical, biophysical, and cellular assays, STX-721 demonstrated superior ex20ins-mutant selectivity relative to other tested benchmark clinical phase compounds and achieved ex20ins-mutant-selective tumor regression in vivo.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These data highlight that STX-721 shows a high level of mutant EGFR selectivity across human preclinical cancer models and may provide an improved clinical efficacy versus adverse event profile relative to existing drugs.",

    "abstract": "A lectin-like protein was discovered in Agaricus bisporus as part of the mushroom tyrosinase complex. The protein has a \u03b2-trefoil fold, which is typical of the ricin B-like-type lectin family. The structure of the recombinant protein has been elucidated, and its specific sugar-binding affinity towards mannose and mannitol has also been reported; therefore, the protein was named A. bisporus mannose-binding protein (Abmb). Although the sugar-binding site of Abmb is predicted to be close to the C-terminus, the sugar-binding site has not yet been determined. In this study, a variant of recombinant Abmb with a longer C-terminal region including a 6\u00d7His-tag was constructed and its structure was solved at 1.51 and 2.34\u2005\u00c5 resolution in an orthorhombic and a monoclinic space group, respectively. The overall structure showed a \u03b2-trefoil fold as previously reported; however, several surface loop regions including the C-terminal region showed high flexibility. In addition, a glycan-search assay of this variant showed weak binding affinity towards \u03b2-D-galactose but no affinity towards \u03b1-D-mannose. The plasticity of the C-terminal tail could be related to the differences in the carbohydrate-binding affinity of Abmb.",

    "abstract": "The protein midnolin (MIDN) augments proteasome activity in lymphocytes and dramatically facilitates the survival and proliferation of B-lymphoid malignancies. MIDN binds both to proteasomes and to substrates, but the mode of interaction with the proteasome is unknown, and the mechanism by which MIDN facilitates substrate degradation in a ubiquitin-independent manner is incompletely understood. Here, we present cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the substrate-engaged, MIDN-bound human proteasome in two conformational states. MIDN induces proteasome conformations similarly to ubiquitinated substrates by using its ubiquitin-like domain to bind to the deubiquitinase RPN11 (PSMD14). By simultaneously binding to RPN1 (PSMD2) with its C-terminal \u03b1-helix, MIDN positions its substrate-carrying Catch domain above the proteasome ATPase channel through which substrates are translocated before degradation. Our findings suggest that both ubiquitin-like domain and C-terminal \u03b1-helix must bind to the proteasome for MIDN to stimulate proteasome activity.",

    "abstract": "Metal-peptide frameworks (MPFs) are a growing class of metal-organic frameworks with promising applications in metalloprotein mimicry, chiral separations, and catalysis. There are limited examples of MPFs, especially those with both secondary structure and natural amino acid side chains that coordinate to metal nodes, which are important for accurately mimicking metalloprotein active sites. Here, we design a robust and modular strategy based on short \u03b1-helical peptides (nine amino acids long) to form frameworks with many types of biomimetic metal sites. Peptides were designed to have Glu and His metal-binding residues, hydrophobic residues, and noncanonical helix-enforcing residues. With Co(II), it was shown that mutagenesis of a single amino acid near the metal-binding residues generates a diverse library of frameworks with varying metal node coordination geometries and compositions. Structures for 16 out of 20 variants were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, revealing how noncovalent interactions impact the metal primary sphere. In one case, a point mutation turns on reversible ligand-triggered conformational changes, demonstrating that this platform allows for dynamic behavior like that observed in metalloproteins. Furthermore, we show that frameworks readily assemble with Mn(II), Fe(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) ions, highlighting the generality of this approach. The ease-of-synthesis, modularity, and crystallinity of these materials make this a highly accessible platform for studying and engineering biomimetic metal centers in porous materials.",

In this study, we identify GpsI as a novel and underexplored drug target.

Biochemical and physiological analyses of engineered GpsI variants and recombinant Mycobacterium smegmatis pinpoint amino acids 328 and 527 as critical residues for the selective activity of X1 against Mtb complex. High-resolution cryo-electron microscopy\u00a0analysis of the ternary GpsI-X1-poly(A) complex elucidates the drug-binding pocket, providing insight into its mechanism of action.

These systems can be divided into two classes, with class 2 comprising three types (II, V, and VI). Because of their ability to cleave double-stranded DNA, many class 2 CRISPR-Cas proteins have been harnessed as genome editing tools. Unlike the well-studied type II Cas9 proteins, the structural studies of the type V-B Cas12b proteins are limited, hindering their engineering and broader application. Here, we report four complex structures of ChCas12b, which reveal many unique structural features. The folding of the single guide RNA (sgRNA) of ChCas12b is distinct from that of AacCas12b and BthCas12b. Notably, many of these unique features are involved in ChCas12b-sgRNA interaction, suggesting that they are co-evolved. While ChCas12b shares a conserved two-cation-assisted catalytic mechanism with its homologs, it recognizes a longer guide:target heteroduplex, potentially offering higher fidelity in DNA editing. Altogether, our studies suggested that Cas12b family proteins exhibit significant diversity in their folding, sgRNA\u00a0and target DNA binding. In the future, it is worth characterizing more representative proteins to identify CRISPR-Cas proteins with higher gene editing ability and fidelity.",

    "abstract": "Uncontrolled activation of the rat sarcoma (RAS)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway drives tumor growth, often because of oncogenic BRAF mutations. BRAF regulation, involving monomeric autoinhibition and activation by dimerization, has been intensely scrutinized, but mechanisms enabling oncogenic mutants to evade regulation remain unclear. By using cryo-electron microscopy, we solved the three-dimensional structures of the three oncogenic BRAF mutant classes, including the common V600E variant. These mutations disrupted wild-type BRAF's autoinhibited state, mediated by interactions between the cysteine-rich domain and kinase domain, thereby shifting the kinase domain into a preactivated conformation. This structural change likely results from helix \u03b1C displacement. PLX8394, a BRAF inhibitor that stabilizes helix \u03b1C in an inactive conformation, restored the autoinhibited conformation of oncogenic BRAF, explaining the properties of this class of compounds.",

    "abstract": "The eukaryotic leading-strand DNA polymerase \u03b5 (Pol\u03b5) is a dual-function enzyme with a proofreading 3'-5' exonuclease (<i>exo</i>) site located 40 \u00c5 from the DNA synthesizing <i>pol</i> site. Errors in Pol\u03b5 proofreading can cause various mutations, including C-to-G transversions, the most prevalent mutation in cancers and genetic diseases. Pol\u03b5 interacts with all three subunits of the PCNA ring to assemble a functional holoenzyme. Despite previous studies on proofreading of several Pol's, how Pol\u03b5-or any Pol complexed with its sliding clamp-proofreads a mismatch generated in situ has been unknown. We show here by cryo-EM that a template/primer DNA substrate with a preexisting mismatch cannot enter the <i>exo</i> site of Pol\u03b5-PCNA holoenzyme, but a mismatch generated in situ in the <i>pol</i> site yields three bona fide proofreading intermediates of Pol\u03b5-PCNA holoenzyme. These intermediates reveal how the mismatch is dislodged from the <i>pol</i> site, how the DNA unwinds six base pairs, and how the unpaired primer 3'-end is inserted into the <i>exo</i> site for cleavage. These results unexpectedly demonstrate that PCNA imposes strong steric constraints that extend unwinding and direct the trajectory of mismatched DNA and that this trajectory is dramatically different than for Pol\u03b5 in the absence of PCNA. These findings suggest a physiologically relevant proofreading mechanism for the human Pol\u03b5 holoenzyme.",

We previously performed an x-ray crystallography-based fragment screen and found submicromolar inhibitors by fragment linking. However, these compounds had poor membrane permeability and liabilities that complicated optimization. Here, we developed a shape-based virtual screening pipeline-FrankenROCS. We screened the Enamine high-throughput collection of 2.1 million compounds, selecting 39 compounds for testing, with the most potent binding with a 130 \u03bcM median inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>). We then paired FrankenROCS with an active learning algorithm (Thompson sampling) to efficiently search the Enamine REAL database of 22 billion molecules, testing 32 compounds with the most potent binding with a 220 \u03bcM IC<sub>50</sub>. Further optimization led to analogs with IC<sub>50</sub> values better than 10 \u03bcM. This lead series has improved membrane permeability and is poised for optimization. FrankenROCS is a scalable method for fragment linking to exploit synthesis-on-demand libraries.",

    "abstract": "The development of the KRAS G12C inhibitor sotorasib is a major advance toward drugging KRAS. However, the G12C mutation is only found in about 10% of KRAS-driven tumors. KRAS possesses several tyrosine amino acids that could provide alternative sites for covalent drug development. Here, a library of aryl sulfonyl fluorides identified 1 (SOF-436) as an inhibitor of KRAS nucleotide exchange by guanine exchange factor SOS<sub>1</sub> and KRAS binding to effector protein rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma kinase (RAF). Tyr-64 is the major reaction site of 1 (SOF-436), although minor reaction at Tyr-71 is also observed. The fragment binds to the Switch II pocket of KRAS based on whole protein mass spectrometry, nucleotide exchange, effector protein binding, and nuclear magnetic resonance studies. Cocrystal structures of smaller fragments covalently bound to KRAS at Tyr-71 provide a strategy for the development of Switch I/II KRAS covalent inhibitors. A bioluminescent resonance energy transfer (NanoBRET) assay reveals that the compounds inhibit KRAS binding to RAF in mammalian cells. Although not yet suitable as chemical probes, these fragments provide starting points to develop small molecules to investigate tyrosine as a nucleophile for covalent inhibition of KRAS in tumors.",

    "abstract": "Integrins consist of 24 species, each with unique tissue expression profiles and distinct biological functions. The \u03b2 subunit of integrin interacts with the FERM-folded head domain of talin through an NPxY/F motif, triggering integrin activation. Although this motif is conserved across most integrin-\u03b2 subunits, the precise molecular mechanism governing talin's selective recognition of different integrin-\u03b2 subunits remains unclear. We identify two distinct configurations of the talin head when interacting with \u03b22 and \u03b23 integrins, providing critical insights into subunit-specific recognition of integrins. Structural studies reveal that mutations at the subdomain interface of the talin head can shift its \u03b22-bound configuration to a \u03b23-bound configuration. This shift enhances \u03b22-integrin affinity, leading to increased lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)-mediated natural killer cell activity. Together, our data elucidate the structural basis of talin's role in mediating integrin activation in a subunit-specific manner and advance our understanding of how talin may regulate diverse functions of various integrin species.",

Earlier studies indicated that ZXC21 and ZC45 may be involved in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. However, the cell invasion mechanisms of ZXC21 and ZC45 remain unclear. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the ZXC21 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and found that the core structure shared high similarity with SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, human coronavirus (HCoV)-HKU1, SARS-CoV, and HCoV-OC43 RBDs, whereas the receptor-binding motifs (RBMs) differ. We demonstrated that the ZXC21 RBD had no interaction with the human coronavirus receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP4), aminopeptidase N (APN), or transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Moreover, the P5S-3B11 Fab can bind to the ZXC21 RBD, indicating that this SARS-CoV-2 core-targeting antibody may retain neutralizing activity toward the ZXC21 coronavirus. Our results revealed the bat coronavirus ZXC21 RBD structure, which may provide further insights into the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the other human beta-coronaviruses.",

To induce antibodies against conserved receptor-binding domain (RBD) regions of SARS-like betacoronavirus (sarbecovirus) spike proteins that recognize SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and zoonotic sarbecoviruses, we developed mosaic-8b RBD nanoparticles presenting eight sarbecovirus RBDs arranged randomly on a 60-mer nanoparticle. Mosaic-8b immunizations protected animals from challenges from viruses whose RBDs were matched or mismatched to those on nanoparticles. Here, we describe neutralizing mAbs isolated from mosaic-8b-immunized rabbits, some on par with Pemgarda, the only currently FDA-approved therapeutic mAb. Deep mutational scanning, in vitro selection of spike resistance mutations, and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structures of spike-antibody complexes demonstrated targeting of conserved RBD epitopes. Rabbit mAbs included critical D-gene segment RBD-recognizing features in common with human anti-RBD mAbs, despite rabbit genomes lacking an equivalent human D-gene segment, thus demonstrating that the immune systems of humans and other mammals can utilize different antibody gene segments to arrive at similar modes of antigen recognition. These results suggest that animal models can be used to elicit anti-RBD mAbs with similar properties to those raised in humans, which can then be humanized for therapeutic use, and that mosaic RBD nanoparticle immunization coupled with multiplexed screening represents an efficient way to generate and select broadly cross-reactive therapeutic pan-sarbecovirus and pan-SARS-CoV-2 variant mAbs.",

    "abstract": "PARP4 is an ADP-ribosyltransferase typically associated with the cytoplasmic vault organelle. PARP4 has a distinct domain composition relative to other PARP enzymes; however, the N-terminal region of PARP4 is homologous to a collection of domains found in PARP1, a regulator of multiple nuclear processes including the cellular response to DNA damage. The N-terminal region of PARP4 interacts in vitro with nucleic acid, in particular a noncoding RNA associated with vault particles, and a BRCT domain is implicated in this interaction. Here, we report the X-ray structure of the BRCT domain of PARP4 and structure-based mutagenesis that interrogates the nucleic acid-binding activity using vault RNA. The isolated BRCT domain is capable of mediating interaction with vault RNA, and we identified four BRCT mutants that disrupt vault RNA interaction to varying degrees. X-ray structures of the BRCT mutants indicate that perturbations to an electropositive region of the BRCT surface underlie the loss of nucleic acid binding. Comparison to other nucleic acid-binding BRCT domains highlights distinct features of the PARP4 BRCT structure. The study presents the experimental structure of the PARP4 BRCT domain, establishes this domain as nucleic acid-binding module, and provides PARP4 BRCT mutants that can be used to investigate PARP4 cellular functions.",

    "abstract": "Nonenzymatic RNA copying is thought to have been responsible for the replication of genetic information during the origin of life. However, chemical copying with the canonical nucleotides (A, U, G, and C) strongly favors the incorporation of G and C and disfavors the incorporation of A and especially U because of the stronger G:C vs. A:U base pair and the weaker stacking interactions of U. Recent advances in prebiotic chemistry suggest that the 2-thiopyrimidines were precursors to the canonical pyrimidines, raising the possibility that they may have played an important early role in RNA copying chemistry. Furthermore, 2-thiouridine (s<sup>2</sup>U) and inosine (I) form by deamination of 2-thiocytidine (s<sup>2</sup>C) and A, respectively. We used thermodynamic and crystallographic analyses to compare the I:s<sup>2</sup>C and A:s<sup>2</sup>U base pairs. We find that the I:s<sup>2</sup>C base pair is isomorphic and isoenergetic with the A:s<sup>2</sup>U base pair. The I:s<sup>2</sup>C base pair is weaker than a canonical G:C base pair, while the A:s<sup>2</sup>U base pair is stronger than the canonical A:U base pair, so that a genetic alphabet consisting of s<sup>2</sup>U, s<sup>2</sup>C, I, and A generates RNA duplexes with uniform base pairing energies. Consistent with these results, kinetic analysis of nonenzymatic template-directed primer extension reactions reveals that s<sup>2</sup>C and s<sup>2</sup>U substrates bind similarly to I and A in the template, and vice versa. Our work supports the plausibility of a potentially primordial genetic alphabet consisting of s<sup>2</sup>U, s<sup>2</sup>C, I, and A and offers a potential solution to the long-standing problem of biased nucleotide incorporation during nonenzymatic template copying.",

Here, we performed a systematic cryo-electron microscopic investigation of the conformational landscape of full-length human dynein 1 in reaction, in various nucleotide conditions, on and off microtubules. Our approach reveals over 40 high-resolution structures, categorized into eight states, providing a dynamic and comprehensive view of dynein throughout its mechanochemical cycle. The described intermediate states reveal mechanistic insights into dynein function, including a 'backdoor' phosphate release model that coordinates linker straightening, how microtubule binding enhances adenosine triphosphatase activity through a two-way communication mechanism and the crosstalk mechanism between AAA1 and the regulatory AAA3 site. Our findings also lead to a revised model for the force-generating powerstroke and reveal means by which dynein exhibits unidirectional stepping. These results improve our understanding of dynein and provide a more complete model of its mechanochemical cycle.",

These bnAb precursors, that target the CD4 receptor binding site, had undergone somatic hypermutation characteristic of the VRC01-class. A subset of isolated VRC01-class monoclonal antibodies neutralized wild-type pseudoviruses and was structurally extremely similar to bnAb VRC01.

    "abstract": "8-oxoGuanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) is the first known target of organocatalytic switches (ORCAs), which rewrite the biochemical function of the enzyme through redirection of its preferred substrate from 8-oxoG to AP sites. Previously, different ORCA chemotypes were shown to enhance the operational pH window for OGG1, possibly through direct involvement in proton transfer events during DNA strand cleavage. Accordingly, compound pK<sub>a</sub> is a crucial and necessary consideration for the identification and application of future OGG1 ORCAs. Here, we identify a minimal structure of organocatalytic switches-4-anilino pyridines and 6-anilino pyrimidines-which are dimethyl-amino-pyridine (DMAP)-type Br\u00f8nsted bases binding the active site of OGG1. Systematic interrogation of compound basicity through modulation of electron-withdrawing (EWG) and electron-donating (EDG) substituents reveals that a pK<sub>a</sub> less or equal to the assay pH is a viable parameter for prediction of compound activity. The lead structure (AC<sub>50</sub> 13\u00a0nM, pK<sub>a</sub> 7.0) was then identified as a potent scaffold from a screen in a patient-derived 3D model of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), where it reduced hepatic fibrosis by 35%. Collectively, these findings deepen the knowledge of this novel modulator class, with important implications for future enzyme targets and probe development.",

A link between BEST1 and the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter <i>\u03b3</i>-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has been proposed. The most appreciated receptors for extracellular GABA are the GABA<sub>B</sub> G-protein-coupled receptors and the pentameric GABA<sub>A</sub> chloride channels, both of which have fundamental roles in the central nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that BEST1 is directly activated by GABA. Through functional studies and atomic-resolution structures of human and chicken BEST1, we identify a GABA binding site on the channel's extracellular side and determine the mechanism by which GABA binding stabilizes opening of the channel's central gate. This same gate, \"the neck,\" is activated by intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], indicating that BEST1 is controlled by ligands from both sides of the membrane. The studies demonstrate that BEST1, which shares no structural homology with GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, is a GABA-activated chloride channel. The physiological implications of this finding remain to be studied.",

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a highly conserved phosphatase that regulates cell signaling and is a tumor suppressor. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to investigate the mechanisms of human p107 substrate and Eya3 regulator recruitment to the PP2A:B55 holoenzyme. We show that, while they associate with B55 using a common set of interaction pockets, the mechanism of substrate and regulator binding differs and is distinct from that observed for PP2A:B56 and other PPPs. We also identify the core B55 recruitment motif in Eya3 proteins, a sequence conserved amongst the Eya family. Lastly, using NMR-based dephosphorylation assays, we demonstrate how B55 recruitment directs PP2A:B55 fidelity through the selective dephosphorylation of specific phosphosites. As PP2A:B55 orchestrates mitosis and DNA damage repair, these data provide a roadmap for pursuing new avenues to therapeutically target this complex by individually blocking a subset of regulators that use different B55 interaction sites.",

    "abstract": "In animals, AGO-clade Argonaute proteins utilize small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) as guides to recognize target with complete complementarity, resulting in target RNA cleavage that is a critical step for target silencing. These proteins feature a constricted nucleic acid-binding channel that limits base pairing between the guide and target beyond the seed region. How the AGO-siRNA complexes overcome this structural limitation and achieve efficient target cleavage remains unclear. We performed cryo-electron microscopy of human AGO-siRNA complexes bound to target RNAs of increasing lengths to examine the conformational changes associated with target recognition and cleavage. Initially, conformational transition propagates from the opening of the PAZ domain and extends through a repositioning of the PIWI-L1-N domain toward the binding channel, facilitating the capture of siRNA-target duplex. Subsequent extension of base pairing drives the downward movement of the PIWI-L1-N domain to enable catalytic activation. Finally, further base pairing toward the 3' end of siRNA destabilizes the PAZ-N domain, resulting in a \"uni-lobed\" architecture, which might facilitate the multi-turnover action of the AGO-siRNA enzyme complex. In contrast to PIWI-clade Argonautes, the \"uni-lobed\" structure of the AGO complex makes multiple contacts with the target in the central region of the siRNA-target duplex, positioning it within the catalytic site. Our findings shed light on the stepwise mechanisms by which the AGO-siRNA complex executes target RNA cleavage and offer insights into the distinct operational modalities of AGO and PIWI proteins in achieving such cleavage.",

    "abstract": "The Kunitz-Soybean Trypsin Inhibitor (Kunitz-STI) is a protein family found in different plants. Several of its members have been experimentally described as inhibitors of various classes of proteases from several organisms. Even though most of the previous crystallographic studies describing the protease inhibition interactions present by different Kunitz-STI family members have been focused on serine proteases, the protein family has been proposed as a promising scaffold for multifunctional protease inhibitor design with a wide range of applications. In this work, a crystallographic complex formed between M271, a Kunitz-STI inhibitor obtained from Solanum tuberosum, and porcine trypsin shows a new inhibitory ensemble in which inhibitor's loops \u03b21-\u03b22 and \u03b23-\u03b24 play a central role. Additionally, the structural analysis demonstrates that the inhibition described here follows a non-canonical mechanism in which the inhibitor loops block the trypsin active site. Our findings expand the repertoire of protease-binding loops in which a Kunitz-STI inhibitor can inhibit trypsin, emphasizing the role of the dynamic characteristics of this protein family member on the protease inhibition process. This work also gives a new example of the remarkable plasticity of the Kunitz-STI fold, in which an arrangement with eleven highly sequence-variable loops projected to the solvent demonstrates a simple answer for a multifunctional evolutionary tool to inhibit proteases.",

Following structural optimization through directed evolution, a broad substrate scope with high enantioselectivities is achieved. Furthermore, the crystal structure of the CTB10-based photoenzyme-substrate complex well demonstrates how the catalytic chiral cavity is sculpted to promote efficient and selective light-enabled deracemization.

We carried out bioinformatics analysis, which indicated that ParM genes are not only confined to plasmids but are also occasionally found on genomes. Here we report the discovery and characterization of two chromosome-encoded ParMs (cParMs) from the genomes of Desulfitobacterium hafniense (Dh-cParM1) and Clostridium botulinum (Cb-cParM). Both cParMs form filaments, exhibit nucleotide hydrolysis, and possess characteristic ParM subunit structures. Dh-cParM1 forms single and tightly coupled double filaments and is highly conserved on the chromosomes of five of six Desulfitobacterium species. Interestingly, these bacteria have not been reported to harbor plasmids. Cb-cParM possesses unique properties. Its filaments were stable after nucleotide hydrolysis and Pi release, and its ParR (Cb-cParR) did not affect the initial phase of Cb-cParM polymerization but displayed properties of a depolymerization factor for mature filaments. These results indicate functional, polymerizing ParMs can be encoded on genomes, suggesting that ParM roles may extend to other functions beyond plasmid segregation.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is a promising target for addressing various neurological disorders and melanoma. Our discovery of a series of truncated pyridinylbenzylamines has yielded potent, selective, and membrane permeable inhibitors of human neuronal nitric oxide synthase. By implementing an efficient synthetic procedure using the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction, we were able to rapidly identify a potent inhibitor. This new inhibitor (18, 6-(2,3-difluoro-5-((methylamino)methyl)phenyl)-4-methylpyridin-2-amine dihydrochloride) exhibits excellent potency, with K<sub>i</sub> values of 30\u00a0nM for human nNOS and 40\u00a0nM for rat nNOS. It also demonstrates high isoform selectivity, showing an 821-fold preference for human nNOS over human endothelial NOS (eNOS) and a 75-fold selectivity over human inducible NOS (iNOS). Additionally, inhibitor 18 displays high permeability (P<sub>e</sub>\u00a0=\u00a010.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-6</sup>\u00a0cm\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>) in an artificial membrane permeability assay. The crystal structures of several NOS-inhibitor complexes provide valuable structural insights into the potency and selectivity of this series of novel inhibitors. A particularly notable finding is the unexpected role of a Cl<sup>-</sup> anion bound to heNOS, which contributes to the high isoform selectivity of these inhibitors and explains why heNOS binds Cl<sup>-</sup>, while hnNOS does not. This unique Cl<sup>-</sup> binding site could be important in future inhibitor design, opening new avenues for the development of more selective NOS inhibitors. Additionally, the presented crystal structures reveal the key factors required to maintain both high potency and selectivity in the simplified inhibitors discussed in this study.

    "abstract": "Activating mutations in the rat sarcoma (RAS) genes HRAS, NRAS and KRAS collectively represent the most frequent oncogenic driver in human cancer<sup>1</sup>. They have previously been considered undruggable, but advances in the past few years have led to the clinical development of agents that target KRAS(G12C) and KRAS(G12D) mutants, yielding promises of therapeutic responses at tolerated doses<sup>2</sup>. However, clinical agents that selectively target NRAS(Q61*) mutants\u00a0(* represents 'any'), the second-most-frequent oncogenic driver in melanoma, are still lacking. Here we identify SHOC2, a component of the SHOC2-MRAS-PP1C complex, as a dependency of RAS(Q61*) tumours in a nucleotide-state-dependent and isoform-agnostic manner. Mechanistically, we found that oncogenic NRAS(Q61R) forms a direct interaction with SHOC2, evidenced by\u00a0X-ray co-crystal structure. In vitro high-throughput screening enabled the discovery of small molecules that bind to SHOC2 and disrupt the interaction with NRAS(Q61*). Structure-based optimization led to a cellularly active tool compound that shows inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling and proliferation in RAS-mutant cancer models, most notably in NRAS(Q61*) settings. These findings provide evidence for a neomorph SHOC2-(canonical)RAS protein interaction that is pharmacologically actionable and relevant to cancer sustenance. Overall, this work provides the concept validation and foundation for developing new therapies at the core of the RAS signalling pathway.",

    "abstract": "The Tet(X) flavin-dependent monooxygenases enable tetracycline antibiotic resistance by catalysing inactivating hydroxylation, so preventing inhibition of bacterial ribosomes. Tet(X) resistance is growing rapidly, threatening the efficacy of important last-resort tetracyclines such as tigecycline. Tet(X) inhibitors have potential to protect tetracyclines in combination therapies, but their discovery has been hampered by lack of high-throughput assays. We report the development of an efficient fluorescence polarisation Tet(X) binding assay employing a tetramethylrhodamine-glycyl-minocycline conjugate that enables inhibitor discovery. The assay was applied to tetracycline substrates and reported inhibitors, providing insight into their binding modes. Screening of a bioactive molecule library identified novel Tet(X) inhibitors, including psychoactive phenothiazine derivatives and the 5-HT<sub>4</sub> agonist tegaserod, the activities of which were validated by turnover assays. Crystallographic studies of Tet(X4)-inhibitor complexes reveal two new inhibitor binding modes, importantly providing evidence for active site binding of Tet(X) inhibitors that do not share structural similarity with tetracycline substrates. In some cases, potentiation of tigecycline activity was observed in bacteria expressing Tet(X4). The combined results provide non-tetracycline scaffolds for development of potent Tet(X) inhibitors and highlight the need to evaluate the impact of non-antibiotics on antimicrobial resistance.",

    "abstract": "To generate antibodies (Abs) against SARS-CoV-2 emerging variants, we integrated multiple tools and engineered molecules with excellent neutralizing breadth and potency. Initially, the screening of an immune library identified a nanobody (Nb), termed Nb4, specific to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the Omicron BA.1 variant. A Nb4-derived heavy chain antibody (hcAb4) recognized the spike (S) of the Wuhan, Beta, Delta, Omicron BA.1, and BA.5 SARS-CoV-2 variants. A high-resolution crystal structure of the Nb4 variable (VHH) domain in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Wuhan) defined the Nb4 binding mode and interface. The Nb4 VHH domain grasped the RBD and covered most of its outer face, including the core and the receptor-binding motif (RBM), which was consistent with hcAb4 blocking RBD binding to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. In mouse models, a humanized hcAb4 showed therapeutic potential and prevented the replication of SARS-CoV-2\u2009BA.1 virus in the lungs of the animals. <i>In vitro</i>, hcAb4 neutralized Wuhan, Beta, Delta, Omicron BA.1, and BA.5 viral variants, as well as the BQ.1.1 subvariant, but showed poor neutralization against the Omicron XBB.1.5. Structure-based computation of the RBD-Nb4 interface identified three Nb4 residues with a reduced contribution to the interaction with the XBB.1.5 RBD. Site-saturation mutagenesis of these residues resulted in two hcAb4 mutants with enhanced XBB.1.5 S binding and virus neutralization, further improved by mutant Nb4 trimers. This research highlights an approach that combines library screening, Nb engineering, and structure-based computational predictions for the generation of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron-specific Abs and their adaptation to emerging variants.",

    "abstract": "Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as an indispensable technique in structural biology that is pivotal for deciphering protein architectures. However, the medium-sized proteins (30-40\u2005kDa) that are prevalent in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms often elude the resolving capabilities of contemporary cryo-EM methods. To address this challenge, we engineered a scaffold strategy that securely anchors proteins of interest to a robust, symmetric base via a selective adapter. Our most efficacious constructs, namely models 4 and 6c, feature a designed ankyrin-repeat protein (DARPin) rigidly linked to an octahedral human apoferritin via a helical linker. By utilizing these large, highly symmetric scaffolds (\u223c1\u2005MDa), we achieved near-atomic-resolution cryo-EM structures of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and maltose-binding protein (MBP), revealing nearly all side-chain densities of GFP and the distinct structural features of MBP. The modular design of our scaffold allows the adaptation of new DARPins through minor amino-acid-sequence modifications, enabling the binding and visualization of a diverse array of proteins. The high symmetry and near-spherical shape of the scaffold not only mitigates the prevalent challenge of preferred particle orientation in cryo-EM but also significantly reduces the demands of image collection and data processing. This approach presents a versatile solution, breaking through the size constraints that have traditionally limited single-particle cryo-EM.",

    "abstract": "Apart from the iconic Watson-Crick duplex, DNA can fold into different noncanonical structures, of which the most studied are G-quadruplexes (G4s). Despite mounting structural and biophysical evidence, their existence in cells was controversial until their detection using G4-specific antibodies. However, it remains unknown how antibodies recognize G4s at the molecular level\u00a0and why G4-specific antibodies have low selectivity and are unable to distinguish different G4 sequences. Here, we present the crystal structure of a nanobody bound to the archetypical G4 structure, the thrombin-binding aptamer (TBA). The nanobody exhibits strong selectivity against different G4 sequences and utilizes an unusual scaffold-based paratope, with very limited involvement of complementarity-determining region. The nanobody effectively mimics the binding interface of thrombin, a natural binding partner of TBA, by using isosteric interactions at key positions. The presented structure sheds light on the molecular basis of how antibodies, essential G4-detection tools, recognize noncanonical G4 structures.",

    "abstract": "There is an urgent need for new antibiotics. FabF (3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase 2), which catalyses the rate limiting condensation reaction in the fatty acid synthesis II pathway, is an attractive target. Very few inhibitors of FabF are known and most are derived from natural products. In an effort to further explore the chemical space of FabF ligands, we have carried out fragment screening by X-ray crystallography against an intermediated state-mimicking variant of P. aeruginosa FabF (PaFabF C164Q). This screen has resulted in 48 hits out of which 16 bind in or close to the malonyl-CoA or fatty acid binding site or an adjacent dimer interface. None of the closer investigated fragments were active in a binding assay, but the same was the case for fragments derived from a potent FabF inhibitor. For hit optimization, we focused on the two fragments binding close to the catalytic residues of FabF. Different strategies were followed in the optimization process: exploration of commercially available analogues, fragment merging, virtual screening of a combinatorial make-on-demand space, and design and in-house synthesis of analogues. In total, more than 90 analogues of the hit compounds were explored, and for 10 of those co-crystal structures could be determined. The most potent ligand was discovered using manual structure-based design and has a binding affinity of 65\u00a0\u03bcM. This data package forms a strong foundation for the development of more potent and diverse FabF inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "The sodium/proton exchanger NHA2, also known as SLC9B2, is important for insulin secretion, renal blood pressure regulation, and electrolyte retention. Recent structures of bison NHA2 has revealed its unique 14-transmembrane helix architecture, which is different from SLC9A/NHE members made up from 13-TM helices. Sodium/proton exchangers are functional homodimers, and the additional N-terminal helix in NHA2 was found to alter homodimer assembly. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy structures of apo human NHA2 in complex with a Fab fragment and also with the inhibitor phloretin bound at 2.8 and 2.9 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. We show how phosphatidic acid (PA) lipids bind to the homodimer interface of NHA2 on the extracellular side, which we propose has a regulatory role linked to cell volume regulation. The ion binding site of human NHA2 has a salt bridge interaction between the ion binding aspartate D278 and R432, an interaction previously broken in the bison NHA2 structure, and these differences suggest a possible ion coupling mechanism. Lastly, the human NHA2 structure in complex with phloretin offers a template for structure-guided drug design, potentially leading to the development of more selective and potent NHA2 inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB), a leading cause of death among infectious diseases globally, is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). The pathogenicity of Mtb is largely attributed to its complex cell envelope, which includes a class of glycolipids called phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides (PIMs). These glycolipids maintain the integrity of the cell envelope, regulate permeability, and mediate host-pathogen interactions. PIMs comprise a phosphatidyl-myo-inositol core decorated with one to six mannose residues and up to four acyl chains. The mannosyltransferase PimE catalyzes the transfer of the fifth PIM mannose residue from a polyprenyl phosphate-mannose (PPM) donor. This step contributes to the proper assembly and function of the mycobacterial cell envelope; however, the structural basis for substrate recognition and the catalytic mechanism of PimE remain poorly understood. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of PimE from Mycobacterium abscessus in its apo and product-bound form. The structures reveal a distinctive binding cavity that accommodates both donor and acceptor substrates/products. Key residues involved in substrate coordination and catalysis were identified and validated via in vitro assays and in vivo complementation, while molecular dynamics simulations delineated access pathways and binding dynamics. Our integrated approach provides comprehensive insights into PimE function and informs potential strategies for anti-TB therapeutics.",

Disclosed herein is the discovery and optimization of a series of DHX9 inhibitors. Compound <b>1</b> was identified as a partial inhibitor of DHX9 ATPase activity but a full inhibitor of unwinding activity. Binding of <b>1</b> to a pocket distinct from the ATP binding site was confirmed by X-ray crystallography, enabling structure-based drug optimization. During this optimization, a sulfur-halogen bond was identified that increased on-target residence time without impacting equilibrium binding affinity. Analysis shows that cell potency more closely correlates with residence time than with equilibrium measurements of binding affinity or biochemical potency. Further optimization of potency and ADME properties led to the identification of <b>ATX968</b>, a potent and selective DHX9 inhibitor that is efficacious in a tumor xenograft model of microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colorectal cancer.",

Despite FDA approval for two irreversible inhibitors that target the inactive state of KRas<sup>G12C</sup>, significant unmet clinical need still exists, and the susceptibility of non-G12C mutants to inactive-state inhibition remains unclear. Here we report the discovery of a novel series of reversible inhibitors that bind in an enlarged version of the switch I-II pocket with nanomolar affinities. Dependent on chemotype these can either preferentially bind to the inactive or active state or bind both with similar affinity. The active-state binders inhibit the Raf interaction for wild-type Ras, and a broad range of oncogenic KRas mutants with nanomolar potency. A subseries of these molecules displays cellular inhibition of Ras-Raf binding, as well as decreased phosphorylation of the downstream protein ERK, demonstrating that potent multivariant Ras inhibitors can be accessed from this novel pocket.",

    "abstract": "Upon infection, the podophages usually eject a couple of proteins from the capsid to form a transmembrane ejectosome on the host cell membrane that facilitates the ejection of viral genome. However, it remains unclear how these proteins of pre-ejectosome are finely assembled at the center of highly packaged genome. Here, we report the intact structure of <i>Anabaena</i> cyanopodophage A4, which consists of a capsid stabilized by two types of cement proteins and a short tail attached with six tail fibers. Notably, we find a pentameric pre-ejectosome at the core of capsid, which is composed of four ejection proteins wrapped into a coaxial cylinder of triple layers. Moreover, a segment of genomic DNA runs along the positively charged circular cleft formed by two ejection proteins. Based on the mortise-and-tenon architecture of pre-ejectosome in combination with previous studies, we propose a putative DNA packaging process and ejection mechanism for podophages. These findings largely enrich our knowledge on the assembly mechanism of podophages, which might facilitate the application of A4 as a chassis cyanophage in synthetic biology.",

    "abstract": "Prokaryotic Argonaute proteins (pAgos) from the long-A clade are stand-alone immune systems that use small interfering DNA (siDNA) guides to recognize and cleave invading plasmid and virus DNA. Certain long-A pAgos are co-encoded with accessory proteins with unknown functions. Here, we show that cyanobacterial long-A pAgos act in conjunction with Argonaute-associated Cas4 family enzyme 1 (ACE1). Structural and biochemical analyses reveal that ACE1-associated pAgos mediate siDNA-guided DNA interference, akin to stand-alone pAgos. ACE1 is structurally homologous to the nuclease domain of bacterial DNA repair complexes and acts as a single-stranded DNA endonuclease that processes siDNA guides. pAgo and ACE1 form a heterodimeric long-A pAgo-ACE1 (APACE1) complex, which modulates ACE1 activity. Although ACE1-associated pAgos alone interfere with plasmids and bacteriophages, plasmid interference is boosted when pAgo and ACE1 are co-expressed. Our study reveals that pAgo-mediated immunity is enhanced by accessory proteins and broadens our mechanistic understanding of how pAgo systems interfere with invading DNA.",

    "abstract": "The members of the annexin family are proteins involved in important biological processes that share a common propensity, mediated by the binding of calcium, to interact with membranes. Despite the remarkable amount of literature reports on these proteins several aspects of their functionality remain obscure. Considering the importance of the pH in modulating annexin activities, we here reassessed the pH dependency (range 4.6-7.4) of the binding of the calcium by human annexin A4 (hAnxA4) and determined its structure from crystals obtained in acidic conditions at nearly atomic resolution in media containing different calcium concentrations. The interactions of calcium ions with hAnxA4 were studied using isothermal titration calorimetry measurements and molecular dynamics simulations. Present solution data corroborate and quantify the pH dependence of the binding of calcium to hAnxA4. Moreover, crystallographic structures provide a clear ranking of the metal affinity of the hAnxA4 calcium binding sites. These findings have been extended by performing computational studies that provide information on the binding affinity of the different calcium sites that are in good agreement with the crystallographic data. Crystallographic data highlight the occurrence of unexpected clusterings of positively charged arginine residues that can cooperate for the binding of the phospholipid phosphate moieties. These crystallographic data integrated with molecular dynamics simulations provide an atomic-level description of the local conformational changes associated with calcium release and upload. Interestingly, docking analyses demonstrate the optimal juxtaposition of these arginine residues and calcium ions to correctly anchor phosphatidylserine.",

    "abstract": "Human lens fiber membrane intrinsic protein MP20 is the second most abundant membrane protein of the human eye lens. Despite decades of effort its structure and function remained elusive. Here, we determined the MicroED structure of full-length human MP20 in lipidic-cubic phase to a resolution of 3.5\u2009\u00c5. MP20 forms tetramers each of which contain 4 transmembrane \u03b1-helices that are packed against one another forming a helical bundle. We find that each MP20 tetramer formed adhesive interactions with an opposing tetramer in a head-to-head fashion. Investigation of MP20 localization in human lenses indicate that in young fiber cells MP20 is initially localized to the cytoplasm in differentiating fiber cells but upon fiber cell maturation is inserted into the plasma membrane, correlating with the restriction of the diffusion of extracellular tracers into the lens. Together these results suggest that MP20 forms lens thin junctions in vivo, confirming its role as a structural protein in the human eye lens essential for its optical transparency.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic K<sub>ATP</sub> channel trafficking defects underlie congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) cases unresponsive to the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel opener diazoxide, the mainstay medical therapy for CHI. Current clinically used K<sub>ATP</sub> channel inhibitors have been shown to act as pharmacochaperones and restore surface expression of trafficking mutants; however, their therapeutic utility for K<sub>ATP</sub> trafficking-impaired CHI is hindered by high affinity binding, which limits functional recovery of rescued channels. Recent structural studies of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels employing cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) have revealed a promiscuous pocket where several known K<sub>ATP</sub> pharmacochaperones bind. The structural knowledge provides a framework for discovering K<sub>ATP</sub> channel pharmacochaperones with desired reversible inhibitory effects to permit functional recovery of rescued channels. Using an AI-based virtual screening technology AtomNet followed by functional validation, we identified a novel compound, termed Aekatperone, which exhibits chaperoning effects on K<sub>ATP</sub> channel trafficking mutations. Aekatperone reversibly inhibits K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) ~9 \u03bcM. Mutant channels rescued to the cell surface by Aekatperone showed functional recovery upon washout of the compound. CryoEM structure of K<sub>ATP</sub> bound to Aekatperone revealed distinct binding features compared to known high affinity inhibitor pharmacochaperones. Our findings unveil a K<sub>ATP</sub> pharmacochaperone enabling functional recovery of rescued channels as a promising therapeutic for CHI caused by K<sub>ATP</sub> trafficking defects.",

    "abstract": "Chuangxinmycin (CXM) is a promising antimicrobial compound targeting bacterial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS), an essential enzyme in protein synthesis. The detailed inhibitory mechanism of CXM, particularly in clinically relevant pathogenic bacteria, is poorly understood. In this study, based on the determination of 10 crystal structures, including <i>Escherichia coli</i> TrpRS (<i>Ec</i>TrpRS) and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> TrpRS (<i>Sa</i>TrpRS) in complex with CXM, ATP, tryptophan, or CXM derivatives, either individually or in combination, as well as the structure of apo-<i>Sa</i>TrpRS, we provide key insights into the binding mode of CXM and its species-specific inhibitory mechanisms. Combined with molecular dynamics simulations and binding energy analysis, we demonstrate that CXM binds to <i>Ec</i>TrpRS in a manner highly similar to the natural substrate tryptophan. Key residues, including D135 and Y128, play critical roles in CXM recognition and fixation, while conserved hydrophobic residues contribute significantly to binding free energy. This binding pattern is consistent with that observed in <i>Geobacillus stearothermophilus</i> TrpRS (<i>Gs</i>TrpRS). However, <i>Sa</i>TrpRS exhibits distinct behavior due to structural differences, particularly the orientation of Y126 (corresponding to Y128 in <i>Ec</i>TrpRS). This difference results in the selectivity of 3-methylchuangxinmycin (mCXM), a CXM derivative, against <i>Sa</i>TrpRS. Furthermore, modeling CXM into the tryptophan-binding site of human cytoplasmic TrpRS (<i>Hs</i>TrpRS) reveals the lack of key hydrogen bonds and a salt bridge interaction, which likely underlies CXM's significantly weaker inhibition of <i>Hs</i>TrpRS. These findings deepen our understanding of the inhibitory mechanism of CXM and its selectivity toward bacterial TrpRSs, and thus can facilitate the design of next-generation antibiotics targeting bacterial TrpRSs.",

The origin of heterodimeric tubulins assembling into microtubules remains unclear. Here, we report the discovery of microtubule-forming tubulins in Asgard archaea, the closest known relatives of eukaryotes. These Asgard tubulins (AtubA/B) are closely related to eukaryotic \u03b1/\u03b2-tubulins and the enigmatic bacterial tubulins BtubA/B. Proteomics of Candidatus Lokiarchaeum ossiferum showed that AtubA/B were highly expressed. Cryoelectron microscopy structures demonstrate that AtubA/B form eukaryote-like heterodimers, which assembled into 5-protofilament bona fide microtubules in\u00a0vitro. The additional paralog AtubB2 lacks a nucleotide-binding site and competitively displaced AtubB. These AtubA/B2 heterodimers polymerized into 7-protofilament non-canonical microtubules. In a sub-population of Ca. Lokiarchaeum ossiferum cells, cryo-tomography revealed tubular structures, while expansion microscopy identified AtubA/B cytoskeletal assemblies. Our findings suggest a pre-eukaryotic origin of microtubules and provide a framework for understanding the fundamental principles of microtubule assembly.",

    "abstract": "Enzyme activity varies with temperature. Unlike small-molecule catalysts, the structural ensembles of enzymes can change substantially with temperature, but it is unclear how this modulates temperature dependent activity. Here, multi-temperature X-ray crystallography was used to record structural changes from -20\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C for a mesophilic enzyme in complex with inhibitors mimicking substrate-, intermediate-, and product-bound states, representative of major complexes on the reaction coordinate. Inhibitors, substrates and active site loops increasingly populated catalytically competent conformations as temperature increased. These changes occurred even in temperature ranges where kinetic measurements showed roughly linear Arrhenius/Eyring behavior, where parameters characterizing the system are assumed to be temperature independent. Simple analysis shows that linear Arrhenius/Eyring behavior can still be observed when the underlying activation energy/enthalpy values vary with temperature. Our results indicate a critical role for temperature dependent atomic-resolution structural data in interpreting temperature dependent kinetic data from enzymatic systems.",

    "abstract": "In the assembly pathway of tailed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bacteriophages and herpesviruses, a procapsid with a dodecameric portal for DNA delivery at a unique vertex is initially formed. Appropriate procapsid assembly requires the transient presence of multiple copies of a scaffolding protein (SP), which is absent in the mature virion. However, how the SP contributes to dodecameric portal formation, facilitates portal and coat protein incorporation, and is subsequently released remains unclear because of a lack of structural information. Here, we present the structure of the SP-portal complex within the procapsid of bacteriophage P22 at 3-9 \u00c5 resolutions. The AlphaFold2-predicted SP model fits well with the density map of the complex. The SP forms trimers and tetramers that interact to yield a dome-like complex on the portal. Two SP domains mediate multimerization. Each trimer interacts with two neighboring portal subunits. The SP has a loop-hook-like structure that aids in coat protein recruitment during viral assembly. The loops of those SP subunits on the portal are positioned in clefts between adjacent portal subunits. Conformational changes in the portal during phage maturation may trigger the disassembly and release of the SP complex. Our findings provide insights into SP-assisted procapsid assembly in bacteriophage P22 and suggest that this strategy is also implemented by other dsDNA viruses, including herpesviruses.",

    "abstract": "Human angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) is involved in vasoregulation, inflammation, and neurodegenerative disorders. The enzyme is formed of two domains; the C-domain (cACE) is primarily involved in blood pressure regulation, whereas the N-domain (nACE) is strongly linked to fibrosis; hence, designing domain-specific inhibitors could make a difference between treating one condition without having a negative effect on another. AnCE (a close homologue of ACE) is derived from <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and has a high similarity specifically to cACE. Due to high similarity and ease of crystallisation, AnCE has been chosen as a model protein for ACE studies and for the design of ACE inhibitors. In this study, enzyme kinetic assays and X-ray crystallography techniques revealed the significance of using dipeptides as selective inhibitors for AnCE and how this knowledge could be applied to cACE and nACE. All the dipeptides tested in this study were shown to bind AnCE in two distinct locations, i.e., the non-prime and prime subsites. It was found that a hydrophobic residue at the S1 and S1' subsites, with a tryptophan at the S2 and S2' subsites, showed highest affinity towards AnCE. It was also observed that a key pocket within the S2' subsite had a major influence on the binding orientation within the prime subsites and could potentially explain ACE's dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity. Importantly these dipeptides are found in functional foods, making them potentially available from diets. Knowledge of the dipeptide binding presented here could aid in the development of ACE domain-specific inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) act as first responders during cellular stress, sequestering destabilized proteins (clients) to prevent aggregation and facilitate refolding or degradation. This critical function, conserved across all life, is linked to proteostasis and protein misfolding diseases. However, the extreme molecular plasticity of sHSP/client complexes has limited mechanistic understanding. Here, we present high-resolution cryo-EM structures of Methanocaldococcus jannaschii sHSP (mjHSP16.5) in apo and multiple client-bound states. The ensemble reveals molecular mechanisms of client sequestration, highlighting cooperative chaperone-client interactions. Client engagement polarizes scaffold stability, promoting higher-order assembly and enhanced sequestration. Higher-order states suggest multiple sHSP/client assembly pathways, including subunit insertion at destabilized geometrical features. These findings provide critical insights into sHSP chaperone function and the interplay between polydispersity and client handling under stress.",

    "abstract": "High-quality grid preparation for single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) remains a bottleneck for routinely obtaining high-resolution structures. The issues that arise from traditional grid preparation workflows are particularly exacerbated for oxygen-sensitive proteins, including metalloproteins, whereby oxygen-induced damage and alteration of oxidation states can result in protein inactivation, denaturation, and/or aggregation. Indeed, 99% of the current structures in the EMBD were prepared aerobically and limited successes for anaerobic cryoEM grid preparation exist. Current practices for anaerobic grid preparation involve a vitrification device located in an anoxic chamber, which presents significant challenges including temperature and humidity control, optimization of freezing conditions, costs for purchase and operation, as well as accessibility. Here, we present a streamlined approach that allows for the vitrification of oxygen-sensitive proteins in reduced states using an automated blot-free grid vitrification device - the SPT Labtech chameleon. This robust workflow allows for high-resolution structure determination of dynamic, oxygen-sensitive proteins, of varying complexity and molecular weight.",

However, during the pulse X-ray-induced site-specific radiation damage can occur, leading to electronic state and/or structural changes. Here, we present a systematic exploration of the effect of single-pulse duration and energy (and consequently different dose rates) on site-specific radiation damage under typical SFX room-temperature experimental conditions. For the first time in SFX we directly measured the photon pulse duration, varying from less than 10\u2005fs to more than 50\u2005fs, and used three pulse energies to probe in-pulse damage in two radiation-sensitive proteins: the iron-heme peroxidase DtpAa and the disulfide-rich thaumatin. While difference-map features arising from radiation damage are observed, they do not lead to significant change in refined atomic coordinates or key bond lengths. Our work thus provides experimental verification that average atomic coordinates are not significantly perturbed by radiation damage in typical SFX experiments.",

    "abstract": "Proteostasis involves degradation and recycling of proteins from organelles, membranes, and multiprotein complexes. These processes can depend on protein extraction and unfolding by the essential mechanoenzyme valosin-containing protein (VCP) and on ubiquitin chain remodeling by ubiquitin-specific proteases known as deubiquitinases (DUBs). How the activities of VCP and DUBs are coordinated is poorly understood. Here, we focus on the DUB VCPIP1, a VCP interactor required for post-mitotic Golgi and ER organization. We determine \u223c3.3 \u00c5 cryogenic electron microscopy structures of VCP-VCPIP1 complexes in the absence of added nucleotide or the presence of an ATP analog. We find that up to 3 VCPIP1 protomers interact with the VCP hexamer to position VCPIP1's catalytic domain at the exit of VCP's central pore, poised to cleave ubiquitin following substrate unfolding. We observe competition between VCPIP1 and other cofactors for VCP binding and show that VCP stimulates VCPIP1's DUB activity. Together, our data suggest how the two enzyme activities can be coordinated to regulate proteostasis.",

    "abstract": "Homo-oligomerization of biological macromolecules leads to functional assemblies that are critical to understanding various cellular processes. However, RNA quaternary structures have rarely been reported. Comparative genomics analysis has identified RNA families containing hundreds of sequences that adopt conserved secondary structures and likely fold into complex three-dimensional structures. In this study, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine structures from four RNA families, including ARRPOF and OLE forming dimers and ROOL and GOLLD forming hexameric, octameric, and dodecameric nanostructures, at 2.6- to 4.6-angstrom resolutions. These homo-oligomeric assemblies reveal a plethora of structural motifs that contribute to RNA multivalency, including kissing-loop, palindromic base-pairing, A-stacking, metal ion coordination, pseudoknot, and minor-groove interactions. These results provide the molecular basis of intermolecular interactions driving RNA multivalency with potential functional relevance.",

MprF modifies inner leaflet lipid headgroups through aminoacylation and translocates modified lipid to the outer leaflet. This activity provides increased resistance to antimicrobial agents. MprF presents a promising target in multiresistant pathogens, but structural information is limited and both substrate specificity and energization of MprF-mediated lipid transport are poorly understood. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of MprF from <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (<i>Pa</i>MprF) bound to a synthetic nanobody. <i>Pa</i>MprF adopts an \"open\" conformation with a wide, lipid-exposed groove on the periplasmic side that induces a local membrane deformation in molecular dynamics simulations. Using an in vitro liposome transport assay, we demonstrate that <i>Pa</i>MprF translocates a wide range of different lipids without an external energy source. This suggests that <i>Pa</i>MprF is the first dedicated lipid scramblase to be characterized in bacteria.",

While marked variations in TCR-p-MHC docking topologies have been observed from structural studies, the co-recognition paradigm has held fast. Using HLA-DQ2.5-peptide tetramers, here we identify a TRAV12-1<sup>+</sup>-TRBV5-1<sup>+</sup> G9 TCR from human peripheral blood that binds HLA-DQ2.5 in a peptide-agnostic manner. The crystal structures of TCR-HLA-DQ2.5-peptide complexes show that the G9 TCR binds HLA-DQ2.5 in a reversed docking topology without contacting the peptide, with the TCR contacting the \u03b21 region of HLA-DQ2.5 and distal from the peptide antigen binding cleft. High-throughput screening of HLA class I and II molecules finds the G9 TCR to be pan-HLA-DQ2 reactive, with leucine-55 of HLA-DQ2.5 being a key determinant underpinning G9 TCR specificity excluding other HLA-II allomorphs. Consistent with the functional assays, the interactions of the G9 TCR and HLA-DQ2.5 precludes CD4 binding, thereby impeding T cell activation. Collectively, we describe a naturally selected \u03b1\u03b2TCR from human peripheral blood that deviates from the TCR-p-MHC co-recognition paradigm.",

    "abstract": "Most members of the dynamin superfamily of large guanosine triphophatases (GTPases) have an ability to remodel membranes in response to guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis. Ring Finger Protein 112 (RNF112) (ZNF179/neurolastin) is a recently identified brain-specific dynamin-like protein possessing a really interesting new gene (RING) finger domain. Despite its essential role as an E3 ligase in neuron development, the architecture of RNF112 and the exact role of its GTPase activity remain unknown. Here, we determined the crystal structure of truncated RNF112 (RNF112<sub>T</sub>) containing a GTPase domain (GD) and three-helical middle domain (MD) at different nucleotide-loading states. In the nucleotide-free (apo) state, the monomeric RNF112<sub>T</sub> remained in a unique self-restraint conformation characterized by docking of the proximal end of the MD to a groove in the GD. At the transition state of GTP hydrolysis, the MD was released from the GD and stretched aside to form an intertwined RNF112<sub>T</sub> homodimer. Engineered RNF112 equipped with the C-terminal elements of ATL1 or the two transmembrane domains of yeast Sac1p relocated to the endoplasmic reticulum and was capable of mediating membrane remodeling. Taken together, our results offer necessary understandings of RNF112 as a dynamin-like large GTPase in its cellular function and provide insights into the functional mechanisms of dynamin superfamily proteins.",

The subunits of human rixosome include PELP1, WDR18, TEX10, LAS1L and NOL9, with LAS1L providing the endoribonuclease activity and NOL9 the RNA 5' kinase activity. We report here cryo-EM structures of the human PELP1-WDR18-TEX10 and LAS1L-NOL9 complexes and a lower-resolution model of the human PELP1-WDR18-LAS1L complex. The structures reveal the overall organization of the human rixosome core scaffold of PELP1-WDR18-TEX10-LAS1L and indicate how the LAS1L-NOL9 endonuclease/kinase catalytic module is recruited to this core scaffold. Each TEX10 molecule has two regions of contact with WDR18, while the helix at the C terminus of WDR18 interacts with the helical domain of LAS1L. The structural observations are supported by our mutagenesis studies. Mutations in both WDR18-TEX10 contact regions can block the binding of TEX10, while truncation of the C-terminal helix of WDR18 can abolish the binding of LAS1L. The structures also reveal substantial conformational differences for TEX10 between the PELP1-WDR18-TEX10 complex alone and that in complex with pre-ribosome.",

    "abstract": "The rise of drug resistances in malaria necessitates the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies. Targeting epigenetic pathways could open new, promising treatment avenues. In this study, the focus is on the essential Bromodomain protein 1 (PfBDP1) of the malaria pathogen Plasmodium falciparum. Utilizing the pan-selective bromodomain inhibitor MPM6, a potent initial hit is identified and it is subsequently developed into a nanomolar binder. Through a combination of virtual docking, isothermal titration calorimetry, and X-ray crystallography, the molecular interactions of the new inhibitors with the bromodomain (BRD) of the protein (PfBDP1-BRD) are elucidated. The findings include the first co-crystallized inhibitors with the structures of PfBRD1-BRD as well as the bromodomain of the close homologous protein of Plasmodium vivax (PvBDP1-BRD). The structures provide new insights into their binding mechanisms. Further validation using conditional knockdown of PfBDP1 in P. falciparum demonstrates parasite sensitivity to the inhibitor, underscoring its potential in a targeted therapeutic approach against malaria.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) is a multisubunit enzyme that copies DNA into RNA in a process known as transcription. Bacteria use \u03c3 factors to recruit RNAP to promoter regions of genes that need to be transcribed, with 60% bacteria containing at least one specialized \u03c3 factor, \u03c3<sup>54</sup>. \u03c3<sup>54</sup> recruits RNAP to promoters of genes associated with stress responses and forms a stable closed complex that does not spontaneously isomerize to the open state where promoter DNA is melted out and competent for transcription. The \u03c3<sup>54</sup>-mediated open complex formation requires specific AAA+ proteins (<u>A</u>TPases <u>A</u>ssociated with diverse cellular <u>A</u>ctivities) known as bacterial enhancer-binding proteins (bEBPs). We have now obtained structures of new intermediate states of bEBP-bound complexes during transcription initiation, which elucidate the mechanism of DNA melting driven by ATPase activity of bEBPs and suggest a mechanistic model that couples the Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis cycle within the bEBP hexamer with \u03c3<sup>54</sup> unfolding. Our data reveal that bEBP forms a nonplanar hexamer with the hydrolysis-ready subunit located at the furthest/highest point of the spiral hexamer relative to the RNAP. ATP hydrolysis induces conformational changes in bEBP that drives a vectoral transiting of the regulatory N terminus of \u03c3<sup>54</sup> into the bEBP hexamer central pore causing the partial unfolding of \u03c3<sup>54</sup>, while forming specific bEBP contacts with promoter DNA. Furthermore, our data suggest a mechanism of the bEBP AAA+ protein that is distinct from the hand-over-hand mechanism proposed for many other AAA+ proteins, highlighting the versatile mechanisms utilized by the large protein family.",

    "abstract": "High-resolution structure determination of membrane proteins typically requires reconstitution into artificial membrane mimics. The choice of the specific membrane substitute can strongly affect the protein's specific activity, stability, and conformational spectrum, potentially leading to errors or misinterpretation during analysis. The bacterial ATP-binding cassette transporter MsbA is a prominent example of such environment-specific bias. Here, we present a systematic analysis of the conformational spectrum of MsbA, stabilized in a dozen environments, using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), and show pronounced feedback between the membrane mimetics and the transporter. Detergents generally favor wide inward-facing conformations while nanodiscs induce narrower conformations. Notably, only in three tested environments, MsbA samples the full movement of the nucleotide-binding domains, including narrow and wide conformations. We expect this study to serve as a blueprint for other membrane proteins, even where a structural reaction to the hydrophobic environment is not directly visible but still critical for the proteins' function.",

    "abstract": "The proper folding of outer membrane proteins in Gram-negative bacteria relies on their delivery to the \u03b2-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex. The mechanism by which survival protein A (SurA), the major periplasmic chaperone, facilitates this process is not well understood. We determine the structure of the holo insertase complex, where SurA binds BAM for substrate delivery. High-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of four different states and a three-dimensional variability analysis show that the holo insertase complex has a large motional spectrum. SurA bound to BAM can undergo a large swinging motion between two states. This motion is uncoupled from the conformational flexibility of the BamA barrel, which can open and close without affecting SurA binding. Notably, we observed conformational coupling of the SurA swing state and the carboxyl-terminal helix grip domain of BamC. Substrate delivery by SurA to BAM appears to follow a concerted motion that encodes a gated delivery pathway through the BAM accessory proteins to the membrane entry site.",

    "abstract": "Micropolymorphisms drastically shape the antigen presentation characteristics of human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules, with profound implications for immune responses and disease susceptibility. HLA-C*12:02 and HLA-C*12:03 are closely related HLA-I allotypes that differ by a single amino acid substitution (R97W) but exhibit distinct associations with disease. HLA-C*12:02 has been shown to provide protective effects against HIV infection, playing a crucial role in controlling viral replication and slowing disease progression, whereas HLA-C*12:03 is associated with increased susceptibility to psoriasis. We determined the X-ray crystal structures of the two allotypes presenting MARELHPEY (MY9) and RAFPGLRYV (RV9). Peptide residues that function as anchors, as well as those accessible for T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) contact, were identified. Our results, combined with those of biochemical studies, demonstrated that the R97W variation alters the peptide-binding groove (PBG) volume and charge, leading to conformational and stability changes in pHLA-C*12 complexes and ultimately affecting peptide-binding preferences for the two HLA-C*12 allotypes. This research not only advances our understanding of the impact of HLA-I micropolymorphisms but also offers clues for the use of structure-guided therapeutics to interfere with peptide binding.",

    "abstract": "<h4>Objective</h4>Along with rising resistance to antimalarials, the emergence of insecticide resistance in Anopheles mosquito species also remains a serious concern. Here, we reveal two potent compounds that show larvicidal and endectocidal activity against malaria vectors, Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles stephensi, respectively.<h4>Methods</h4>We investigated larvicidal activity of two inhibitors against III-instar larvae of Anopheles culicifacies. The survival and fertility of adult female Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes were assessed. Additionally, we purified recombinant prolyl-tRNA synthetase of Anopheles culicifacies and performed enzyme-based assays and structural analysis with the two inhibitors.<h4>Results</h4>Our study reveals that the Anopheles culicifacies prolyl-tRNA synthetase (AcProRS) is potently inhibited by halofuginone (HFG) and an ATP mimetic (L95). The evaluation of larvicidal activity of HFG against Anopheles culicifacies III-instar larvae showed a dose-dependent increase in mortality. In adult female Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes, ingestion of HFG via artificial blood feeding resulted in impaired ovary development, reduced egg laying, and decreased overall survival. The potent enzymatic inhibition of AcProRS thus drives the killing of larvae. The co-crystal structure of AcProRS with inhibitors provides a structural basis for improving their potency as future larvicides.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our data suggest the potential for repositioning halofuginone (HFG) and pyrrolidine-based ATP-mimetics (L95) as larvicides. Targeting the vector-encoded aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases provides a new focus for developing effective agents that can control multiple mosquitoe-borne infectious diseases like malaria and dengue.",

While the inward-open state of human SLC19A1 (hSLC19A1) has been previously described, key aspects regarding its conformational dynamics, substrate selectivity, and precise mechanisms underlying CDNs transport remain elusive. Using an antibody-facilitated conformation screening strategy, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of hSLC19A1 in its outward-open state with and without bound substrates, revealing detailed mechanisms of substrate recognition and conformational changes during transport. We identify both general and specific features for folate/antifolate recognition, including an SLC19A1-specific pocket for accommodating \u03b3-carboxylate-modified antifolates. Intriguingly, CDNs bind as monomers within the canonical pocket of outward-open hSLC19A1, contrasting with dimeric binding in inward-open structures. Together with functional assays, these findings provide a framework for developing antifolate drugs and CDN-targeted therapies, advancing our understanding of SLC19A1's physiological and therapeutic functions.",

    "abstract": "Iron is essential for bacterial growth, and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> synthesizes the siderophores pyochelin (PCH) and pyoverdine to acquire it. PCH contains a thiazolidine ring that aids in iron chelation but is prone to hydrolysis, leading to the formation of 2-(2-hydroxylphenyl)-thiazole-4-carbaldehyde (IQS). Using mass spectrometry, we demonstrated that PCH undergoes hydrolysis and oxidation in solution, resulting in the formation of aeruginoic acid (AA). This study used proteomic analyses and fluorescent reporters to show that AA, dihydroaeruginoic acid (DHA), and PCH induce the expression of <i>femA</i>, a gene encoding the ferri-mycobactin outer membrane transporter in <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. Notably, the induction by AA and DHA was observed only in strains unable to produce pyoverdine, suggesting their weaker iron-chelating ability compared to that of pyoverdine. <sup>55</sup>Fe uptake assays demonstrated that both AA-Fe and DHA-Fe complexes are transported via FemA; however, no uptake was observed for PCH-Fe through this transporter. Structural studies revealed that FemA is able to bind AA<sub>2</sub>-Fe or DHA<sub>2</sub>-Fe complexes. Key interactions are conserved between FemA and these two complexes, with specificity primarily driven by one of the two siderophore molecules. Interestingly, although no iron uptake was noted for PCH through FemA, the transporter also binds PCH-Fe in a similar manner. These findings show that under moderate iron deficiency, when only PCH is produced by <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, degradation products AA and DHA enhance iron uptake by inducing <i>femA</i> expression and facilitating iron transport through FemA. This provides new insights into the pathogen's strategies for iron homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Metalloenzymes play essential roles in biology. However, unraveling how outer-sphere interactions can be predictably controlled to influence their functions remains a significant challenge. Inspired by Cu enzymes, we demonstrate how variations in the primary, secondary, and outer coordination-sphere interactions of de novo designed artificial copper proteins (ArCuPs) within trimeric (3SCC) and tetrameric (4SCC) self-assemblies-featuring a trigonal Cu(His)<sub>3</sub> and a square pyramidal Cu(His)<sub>4</sub>(OH<sub>2</sub>) coordination-influence their catalytic and electron transfer properties. While 3SCC electrocatalyzes C-H oxidation, 4SCC does not. Cu<sup>I</sup>-3SCC reacts more rapidly with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> than O<sub>2</sub>, whereas 4SCC is less active. Electron transfer, reorganization energies, and extended H<sub>2</sub>O-mediated hydrogen bonding patterns provide insights into the observed reactivity differences. The inactivity of 4SCC is attributed to a significant solvent reorganization energy barrier mediated by a specific His---Glu hydrogen bond. When this hydrogen bond is disrupted, the solvent reorganization energy is reduced, and C-H peroxidation activity is restored.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic filamentous fungi pose a significant threat to global food security and human health. The limitations of available antifungal agents, including resistance and toxicity, highlight the need for developing innovative antifungal strategies. Antifungal proteins (AFPs) are a class of secreted small proteins that exhibit potent antifungal activity against filamentous fungi, yet the underlying mechanism remains partially understood. In this study, we investigate the molecular and cellular effects of two AFPs, PgAFP and AfAFP, on Aspergillus flavus, a representative filamentous fungus. These AFPs affect various fungal phenotypes and exert an intracellular effect by interacting with Ntp1, a fungi exclusive protein modulating diverse fungal traits. We find that Ntp1 amino acids 417-588 are critical for AFP binding and play a role in regulating growth, development, sporulation, sclerotia formation, toxin synthesis, and pathogenicity. Results generated from this study will help to control pathogenic fungi.",

    "abstract": "Inorganic phosphate (Pi) has essential metabolic and structural roles in living organisms. The Pi exporter, XPR1/SLC53A1, is critical for cellular Pi homeostasis. When intercellular Pi is high, cells accumulate inositol pyrophosphate (1,5-InsP<sub>8</sub>), a signaling molecule required for XPR1 function. Inactivating XPR1 mutations lead to brain calcifications, causing neurological symptoms including movement disorders, psychosis, and dementia. Here, cryo-electron microscopy structures of dimeric XPR1 and functional characterization delineate\u00a0the substrate translocation pathway and how InsP<sub>8</sub> initiates Pi transport. Binding of InsP<sub>8</sub> to XPR1, but not the related inositol polyphosphate InsP<sub>6</sub>, rigidifies the intracellular SPX domains, with InsP<sub>8</sub> bridging the dimers and SPX and transmembrane domains. Locked in this state, the C-terminal tail is sequestered, revealing the entrance to the transport pathway, thus explaining the obligate roles of the SPX domain and InsP<sub>8</sub>. Together, these findings advance our understanding of XPR1 transport activity and expand opportunities for rationalizing disease mechanisms and therapeutic intervention.",

Here, we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of multi-spanning membrane proteins inserting through the SecY channel, the Sec translocon in prokaryotes. The high-resolution structures illustrate how bulky amino acids pass the narrow channel restriction. Comparison of different translocation states reveals that the cytoplasmic and extracellular cavities of the channel create distinct environments for promoting the unfolding and folding of transmembrane segments (TMs), respectively. Released substrate TMs are either flexible or stabilized by an unexpected hydrophilic groove between TM3 and TM4 of SecY. Disruption of the groove causes global defects in the folding of the membrane proteome. These findings demonstrate that beyond its role as a passive protein-conducting channel, the SecY translocon actively serves as a chaperone, employing multiple mechanisms to promote membrane protein insertion and folding.",

    "abstract": "Hexameric helicases are nucleotide-driven molecular machines that unwind DNA to initiate replication across all domains of life. Despite decades of intensive study, several critical aspects of their function remain unresolved<sup>1</sup>: the site and mechanism of DNA strand separation, the mechanics of unwinding propagation, and the dynamic relationship between nucleotide hydrolysis and DNA movement. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we show that the simian virus 40 large tumour antigen (LTag) helicase assembles in the form of head-to-head hexamers at replication origins, melting DNA at two symmetrically positioned sites to establish bidirectional replication forks. Through continuous heterogeneity analysis<sup>2</sup>, we characterize the conformational landscape of LTag on forked DNA under catalytic conditions, demonstrating coordinated motions that drive DNA translocation and unwinding. We show that the helicase pulls the tracking strand through DNA-binding loops lining the central channel, while directing the non-tracking strand out of the rear, in a cyclic process. ATP hydrolysis functions as an 'entropy switch', removing blocks to translocation rather than directly powering DNA movement. Our structures show the allosteric couplings between nucleotide turnover and subunit motions that enable DNA unwinding while maintaining dedicated exit paths for the separated strands. These findings provide a comprehensive model for replication fork establishment and progression that extends from viral to eukaryotic systems. More broadly, they introduce fundamental principles of the mechanism by which ATP-dependent enzymes achieve efficient mechanical work through entropy-driven allostery.",

    "abstract": "High affinity and selectivity for intended targets is an important goal of small molecule design in drug discovery, yet balancing molecular flexibility and rigidity remains a challenge. While flexible compounds can increase target affinity, they often result in non-specific interactions and reduced selectivity. In contrast, rigid compounds may recognize their target more precisely and have lower off-target effects. In this study, we incorporated a 1,1-dioxido-1,4-thiazine ring into fluorinated benzenesulfonamide derivatives with bulky meta-substituents to enhance selectivity for human carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), an important cancer-associated target. Due to the structural similarities of CAIX with other carbonic anhydrase isozymes, selective inhibition remains a significant challenge. A series of 3,4-substituted trifluorobenzenesulfonamides containing oxidized thiazine rings were synthesized using a novel synthetic pathway. Although the potency against CAIX was modestly reduced compared to more flexible analogs, selectivity increased significantly, with lead compounds 7\u2009d and 7\u2009e exhibiting over 1000-fold selectivity for CAIX over most other isozymes. X-ray crystallography revealed the structural basis for this selectivity, confirming the advantageous positioning of rigidified compounds within some CA isozyme active sites. These findings highlight the potential of molecular rigidity in the design of highly selective inhibitors for therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "Cells tightly regulate ribosome homeostasis to adapt to changing environments. Ribosomes are degraded during stress, but the mechanisms responsible remain unclear. Here, we show that starvation induces the selective depletion of 40S ribosomes following their ubiquitylation by the E3 ligase RNF10. The atypical kinase RIOK3 specifically recognizes these ubiquitylated 40S ribosomes through a unique ubiquitin-interacting motif, visualized by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). RIOK3 binding and ubiquitin recognition are essential for 40S ribosome degradation during starvation. RIOK3 induces the degradation of ubiquitylated 40S ribosomes through progressive decay of their 18S rRNA beginning at the 3' end, as revealed by cryo-EM structures of degradation intermediates. Together, these data define a pathway and mechanism for stress-induced degradation of 40S ribosomes, directly connecting ubiquitylation to regulation of ribosome homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the structural dynamics associated with enzymatic catalysis has been a long-standing goal of biochemistry. With the advent of modern cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), it has become conceivable to redefine a protein's structure as the continuum of all conformations and their distributions. However, capturing and interpreting this information remains challenging. Here, we use classification and deep-learning-based analyses to characterize the conformational heterogeneity of a class I ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) during turnover. By converting the resulting information into physically interpretable 2D conformational landscapes, we demonstrate that RNR continuously samples a wide range of motions while maintaining surprising asymmetry to regulate the two halves of its turnover cycle. Remarkably, we directly observe the appearance of highly transient conformations needed for catalysis, as well as the interaction of RNR with its endogenous reductant thioredoxin also contributing to the asymmetry and dynamics of the enzyme complex. Overall, this work highlights the role of conformational dynamics in regulating key steps in enzyme mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The unique role of proline in modulating protein folding and recognition makes it an attractive target for substitution to generate new proteomimetics. The design, synthesis, and conformational analysis of non-canonical surrogates can also aid in parsing the role of prolyl stereoelectronic effects on structure. We recently described the synthesis and conformational analysis of dehydro-\u03b4-azaproline (\u0394aPro), a novel unsaturated analogue of proline featuring a planar dehydropyrazine ring. When incorporated into host sequences, this backbone N-aminated proline surrogate forms an acylhydrazone bond with an unusually high trans rotamer bias and low isomerization barrier. Here, we used CD, NMR spectroscopy, and MD simulations to evaluate the impact of \u0394aPro substitution within the polyproline II (PPII) and loop regions of the avian pancreatic polypeptide (aPP). The \u0394aPro residue strongly favors PPII conformation and stabilizes the aPP tertiary fold when incorporated at select positions within the miniprotein. A variant featuring three \u0394aPro substitutions was found to significantly enhance the thermal stability of wild-type aPP despite compromising protein dimerization. Our results suggest that the stability of proline-rich folds relies more on backbone torsional preferences than ring puckering and informs strategies for the incorporation of \u0394aPro into thermally stable and functional proteomimetics.",

The OPRT structure consists of an obligate dimer, conserved throughout the phosphoribosyltransferase family. Here, we describe the structural characterization of Burkholderia cenocepacia OPRT (BcOPRT), both by X-ray crystallography and Cryo electron microscopy (Cryo-EM). While the known dimer is present in the structure of BcOPRT, a putative hexameric form was also observed by multiple methods. Analyses by chromatography, Cryo-EM, and kinetics indicate that both dimeric and hexameric forms of this enzyme are present together in solution. Comparison of the kinetics of the native protein and two variants, which were specifically designed to prevent hexamerization, reveal that only the hexameric form is enzymatically active. Collectively, these data suggest that BcOPRT may use oligomerization to control overall enzymatic activity, thus contributing to the local regulation of pyrimidine biosynthesis in this organism.",

    "abstract": "Mono-ADP-ribosyl transferase (mART) proteins are secreted virulence factors produced by several human pathogens, the founding member being diphtheria toxin\u00a0(DT). Pseudomonas aeruginosa can also secrete a mART toxin, known as exotoxin A (PE), but with an organization of its three functional domains (receptor, translocation, and enzymatic elements) that is opposite to DT. Two additional PE-like toxins (PLTs) have been identified from Vibrio cholerae and Aeromonas hydrophila, suggesting more PLT family members may exist. Database mining discovered six additional putative homologues, considerably extending this group of PLTs across a wide range of bacterial species. Here, we examine sequence and structural information for these new family members with respect to previously identified PLTs. The X-ray crystal structures of four new homologues show the conservation of critical features responsible for structure and function. This study shows the potential of these newly described toxins for the development of novel drug delivery platforms. Additionally, genomic analysis suggests horizontal gene transfer to account for the wide distribution of PLTs across a range of eubacteria species, highlighting the need to monitor emerging pathogens and their virulence factors.",

    "abstract": "Macrocycles are abundantly used by nature to enable cell-permeable bioactive molecules. Synthetic non-peptidic macrocycles are also increasingly considered as modalities for difficult-to-bind proteins but guidelines for macrocyclization are only beginning to emerge. Macrocycles are thought to constrain the available conformations but also to allow for residual flexibility, the latter being poorly understood. Here we show that even medium-sized macrocycles display an unexpected high conformational plasticity, even when bound to their protein target. Minor modification of the linker region of macrocycles can shift the conformational ensemble to distinct conformational subclasses, each constituting distinct three-dimensional scaffolds for further optimization. This led to several new ligands with improved affinity and beneficial physicochemical parameters for the FK506-binding protein\u200551, a promising target for depression, obesity and chronic pain. Importantly, none of the beneficial modifications could have been identified by classical medicinal chemistry as they only work in the macrocyclic context. Our results show that macrocyclization can do more than keeping loose ends together but rather provide a platform for multiple series of macrocycles with distinct binding modes.",

However, most animals also have PKSs that do not conform to the rules described in microbes, including a large family of enzymes that bridge fatty acid and polyketide metabolism, the animal FAS-like PKSs (AFPKs). Here, we present the cryoelectron microscopy structures of two AFPKs from sea slugs. While the AFPK resemble mammalian FASs, their chemical products mimic those of PKSs in complexity. How then does the architecture of AFPKs facilitate this structural complexity? Unexpectedly, chemical complexity is controlled not solely by the enzymatic domains but is aided by the dynamics of the acyl carrier protein (ACP), a shuttle that moves intermediates between these domains. We observed interactions between enzyme domains and the linker-ACP domain, which, when manipulated, altered the kinetic properties of the enzyme to change the resulting chemical products. This unveils elaborate mechanisms and enzyme motions underlying lipid and polyketide biochemistry across the domains of life.",

    "abstract": "Since the framing of the Central Dogma, it has been speculated that physically distinct ribosomes within cells may influence gene expression and cellular physiology. While heterogeneity in ribosome composition has been reported in bacteria, protozoans, fungi, zebrafish, mice and humans, its functional implications remain actively debated. Here, we review recent evidence demonstrating that expression of conserved variant ribosomal DNA (rDNA) alleles in bacteria, mice and humans renders their actively translating ribosome pool intrinsically heterogeneous at the level of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). In this context, we discuss reports that nutrient limitation-induced stress in <i>Escherichia coli</i> leads to changes in variant rRNA allele expression, programmatically altering transcription and cellular phenotype. We highlight that cells expressing ribosomes from distinct operons exhibit distinct drug sensitivities, which can be recapitulated <i>in vitro</i> and potentially rationalized by subtle perturbations in ribosome structure or in their dynamic properties. Finally, we discuss evidence that differential expression of variant rDNA alleles results in different populations of ribosome subtypes within mammalian tissues. These findings motivate further research into the impacts of rRNA heterogeneities on ribosomal function and predict that strategies targeting distinct ribosome subtypes may hold therapeutic potential.This article is part of the discussion meeting issue 'Ribosome diversity and its impact on protein synthesis, development and disease'.",

    "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes infectious mononucleosis and is associated with malignancies in humans. Viral infection of B cells is initiated by the viral glycoprotein 350 (gp350) binding to complement receptor 2 (CR2). Despite decades of effort, no vaccines or curative agents have been developed, partly due to lack of atomic-level understanding of the virus-host interface. Here, we determined the 1.7\u00a0\u00c5 structure of gp350 in complex with CR2. CR2 binding of gp350 utilized the same set of Arg residues required for recognition of its natural ligand, complement C3d. We further determined the structures of gp350 in complex with three potently neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) obtained from vaccinated macaques and EBV-infected individuals. Like the CR2 interaction, these nAbs targeted the acidic pocket within the CR2-binding site on gp350 using Arg residues. Our results illustrate two axes of molecular mimicry-gp350 versus C3d and CR2 versus EBV nAbs-offering insights for EBV vaccines and therapeutics development.",

    "abstract": "Conjugative IncX plasmids are vital for spreading clinically significant antibiotic resistance genes. We identified key factors governing the conjugative process of IncX plasmids, the plasmid encoded activator PrfaH and inhibitor H-NS. Deletion of prfaH completely abolishes conjugative transfer, and the PrfaH binding site is an ops-like sequence located downstream of the prfaH promoter. We solved the crystal structure of PrfaH and identified the residues that likely mediate interactions with its target. The IncX3 plasmid-encoded H-NS inhibits conjugation by directly repressing PrfaH expression, while simultaneously enhancing host fitness. This tradeoff between plasmid conjugation and fitness is indispensable for plasmid persistence in nutrient-deprived environments. The presence of PrfaH paralogs in various antibiotic resistance plasmids suggests its fundamental role in regulating plasmid transfer. Our study not only elucidates the regulatory mechanisms behind the horizontal transfer of IncX plasmids but also highlights PrfaH as a potential target for strategies aimed at combating antimicrobial resistance.",

Structure-based evaluations reveal the mechanisms of self-cleavage and self-inhibition in PsiD, along with the sequential catalytic steps from 4-hydroxytryptamine to the final compound, psilocybin. Additionally, we showcase the antidepressant properties of biosynthetic intermediates of psilocybin on female mice experiencing depression-like behaviors induced by sub-chronic variable stress. Our studies establish a structural basis for the future biosynthetic production of psilocybin using these enzymes and emphasize the clinical potential of norbaeocystin.",

    "abstract": "Heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a highly active molecular chaperone that plays a crucial role in cellular function. It facilitates the folding, assembly and stability of various oncogenic proteins, particularly kinases and transcription factors involved in regulating tumor growth and maintenance signaling pathways. Consequently, HSP90 inhibitors are being explored as drugs for cancer therapy. Crystallographic fragment screening is a novel screening method that has been developed in recent years for fragment-based drug discovery and is known for its high hit rate and its ability to provide direct insights into the complex structures of proteins and compounds. In this paper, high-diffraction-resolution crystals of the N-terminal domain of human HSP90\u03b1 were employed in crystallographic fragment screening to discover binding fragments and binding sites. A diverse library of 800 structurally distinct fragments was screened, yielding 91 starting points for the fragment-based drug design of new HSP90\u03b1 N-terminal inhibitors. Nearly a thousand crystals were measured, with 738 being processed and phased using a highly automated data-processing pipeline including data reduction and phasing, refinement and hit identification via PanDDA multi-data-set analysis. The 91 identified compounds bind to eight distinct regions of the HSP90\u03b1 N-terminus, with 63 fragments located in the ATP-binding pocket and its surroundings, thus demonstrating the potential for the development of HSP90\u03b1- and ATP-binding inhibitors. This study emphasizes crystallographic fragment screening as a powerful method that can effectively identify fragment molecules and inhibitors that bind to HSP90\u03b1, contributing to ongoing efforts in cancer drug discovery.",

However, the working mechanism of GGCX remains unclear. Here we report three cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human GGCX: in the apo state, bound to osteocalcin (a VDP) and bound to VK. The propeptide of the VDP binds to the lumenal domain of GGCX, which stabilizes transmembrane helices\u20096 and 7 of GGCX to create the VK-binding pocket. After binding of VK, residue Lys218 in GGCX mediates the oxidation of VK hydroxyquinone, which leads to the deprotonation of glutamate residues and the construction of \u03b3-carboxyglutamate residues. Our structural observations and results from binding and cell\u00a0biological assays and molecular dynamics simulations show that a cholesterol molecule interacts with the transmembrane helices of GGCX to regulate its protein levels in cells.

    "abstract": "<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (<i>S. aureus</i>) is an opportunistic human pathogen that causes over one million deaths around the world each year. We recently identified a family of serine hydrolases termed fluorophosphonate binding hydrolases (Fphs) that play important roles in lipid metabolism and colonization of a host. Because many of these enzymes are only expressed in <i>Staphylococcus</i> bacteria, they are valuable targets for diagnostics and therapeutics. Here, we developed and screened highly diverse cyclic peptide libraries using mRNA display with a genetically encoded oxadiazolone (Ox) electrophile that was previously shown to potently and covalently inhibit multiple Fph enzymes. By performing multiple rounds of counter selections with WT and catalytic dead FphB, we were able to tune the selectivity of the resulting selected cyclic peptides containing the Ox residue toward the active site serine. From our mRNA display hits, we developed potent and selective fluorescent probes that label the active site of FphB at single digit nanomolar concentrations in live <i>S. aureus</i> bacteria. Taken together, this work demonstrates the potential of using direct genetically encoded electrophiles for mRNA display of covalent binding ligands and identifies potent new probes for FphB that have the potential to be used for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "Hollow proteinaceous particles are useful nanometric containers for delivery and catalysis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms and the geometrical theory behind the polymorphic protein assemblies provides a basis for designing ones with the desired morphology. As such, we found that a circularly permuted variant of a cage-forming enzyme, <i>Aquifex aeolicus</i> lumazine synthase, cpAaLS, assembles into a variety of hollow spherical and cylindrical structures in response to changes in ionic strength. Cryogenic electron microscopy revealed that these structures are composed entirely of pentameric subunits, and the dramatic cage-to-tube transformation is attributed to the moderately hindered 3-fold symmetry interaction and the imparted torsion angle of the building blocks, where both mechanisms are mediated by an \u03b1-helix domain that is untethered from the native position by circular permutation. Mathematical modeling suggests that the unique double- and triple-stranded helical arrangements of subunits are optimal tiling patterns, while different geometries should be possible by modulating the interaction angles of the pentagons. These structural insights into dynamic, pentamer-based protein cages and nanotubes afford guidelines for designing nanoarchitectures with customized morphology and assembly characteristics.",

These enzymes, prevalent in prokaryotes, show minimal sequence similarity to other methyltransferases, and the structural determinants of their reactivities remain poorly understood. Herein, we report ligand-bound crystal structures of OvsM from the ovoselenol pathway as well as a member of a previously unknown clade of standalone ovothiol-biosynthetic N\u03c0-methyltransferases, which we have designated OvoM. Unlike previously reported ovothiol methyltransferases, which are fused as a C-terminal domain to the sulfoxide synthase OvoA, OvoMs function independently. Comparative structural analyses reveal conserved, ligand-induced conformational changes, suggesting similar behavior in dual-domain OvoA enzymes. Mutagenesis supports a model where OvoA domain rearrangement facilitates substrate recognition via a critical Tyr residue in the domain linker. Biochemical studies identify an essential active-site Asp, likely serving as a catalytic base in the S<sub>N</sub>2-like nucleophilic substitution reaction.",

    "abstract": "The bifunctional l-fucokinase/GDP-\u03b2-l-fucose pyrophosphorylase (FKP) from Bacteroides fragilis catalyzes the conversion from l-fucose to GDP-\u03b2-l-fucose. The reaction product, representing the activated form of l-fucose, is used by all l-fucosyltransferases to incorporate l-fucose. Herein, we report the first X-ray crystal structures of FKP in complex with substrate-product, leading to the dissection of both activity domains and corresponding catalytic mechanisms. The full-length FKP (FKP-FL, 949 amino acids) exists as a tetramer in solution, but the individually prepared N-terminal domain (FKP-NTD corresponding to the sequence 1-496, also containing a SUMO tag) and C-terminal domain (FKP-CTD, the sequence 519-949) form a monomer and a dimer, respectively. FKP-NTD has a single \u03b1/\u03b2 domain and a \u03b2-helix-containing domain, whereas FKP-CTD folds into two \u03b1/\u03b2 domains and the linker comprises three \u03b1-helices. The \u03b2-l-fucose-1-phosphate (fucose-1-P) and GTP bound separately to the active sites of fucokinase (located at FKP-CTD) and pyrophosphorylase (FKP-NTD), and a third nucleotide-binding site is adjacent to the \u03b2-helix (also in FKP-NTD). Furthermore, Asp762 was proposed to serve as the general base in the reaction of fucokinase, to deprotonate the C1-OH of fucose in the nucleophilic attack to \u03b3-phosphate of ATP, resulting in the formation of fucose-1-P. At the same time, Arg592 and magnesium ion stabilize the developing negative charge in the leaving group (ADP). Subsequently, in the pyrophosphorylase-catalyzed reaction, the Lys187 side chain facilitates the nucleophilic attack of fucose-1-P toward GTP, leading to the formation of GDP-fucose.",

Studies have characterized the biophysical and biochemical properties of G6Pase; however, the structure and substrate recognition mechanism of G6Pase remain unclear. Here, we present two cryo-EM structures of the 40-kDa human G6Pase: a wild-type apo form and a mutant G6Pase-H176A with G6P bound, elucidating the structural basis for substrate recognition and hydrolysis. G6Pase comprises nine transmembrane helices and possesses a large catalytic pocket facing the lumen. Unexpectedly, G6P binding induces substantial conformational rearrangements in the catalytic pocket, which facilitate the binding of the sugar moiety. In conjunction with functional analyses, this study provides critical insights into the structure, substrate recognition, catalytic mechanism, and pathology of G6Pase.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant advancements in kinase-targeted therapy, the emergence of acquired drug resistance to targets such as KRAS and MEK remains a challenge. Extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), positioned at the terminus of this pathway, is highly conserved and less susceptible to mutations, thereby garnering attention as a crucial therapeutical target. However, attempts to use monotherapies that target ERK1/2 have achieved only limited clinical success, mainly due to the issues of limited efficacy and the emergence of drug resistance. Herein, we present a proof of concept that extracellular-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) acts as a compensatory pathway after ERK1/2 inhibition in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). By utilizing the principle of polypharmacology, we computationally designed SKLB-D18, a first-in-class molecule that selectively targets ERK1/2 and ERK5, with nanomolar potency and high specificity for both targets. SKLB-D18 demonstrated excellent tolerability in mice and demonstrated superior in vivo anti-tumor efficacy, not only exceeding the existing clinical ERK1/2 inhibitor BVD-523, but also the combination regimen of BVD-523 and the ERK5 inhibitor XMD8-92. Mechanistically, we showed that SKLB-D18, as an autophagy agonist, played a role in mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) and nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4)-mediated ferroptosis, which may mitigate multidrug resistance.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic behavior of proteins, such as orientation changes of aromatic residues, plays an important role in controlling biomolecular functions. Protein design that can precisely control such dynamic behavior at the atomic level is a challenging issue. The study reports the development of a system capable of orientational changes of aromatic side chains upon ligand binding. Aromatic pockets are constructed on the inner surfaces of protein cages to bind polycyclic aromatic fluorescent molecules to the targeted position by \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions. X-ray crystal structural analysis indicated the cooperative orientation changes of the aromatic clusters around the pocket triggered by the ligand binding. A comparison of various ligands shows that the movement of aromatic clusters can be controlled depending on the ligand structures. Fluorescence quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime are enhanced due to isolation of the fluorescent molecules in an aromatic pocket. These findings provide an understanding of the unique molecular behavior and fluorescence properties of ligands due to the assembly of aromatic residues and a guideline for developing dynamically controlled supramolecular biomaterials.",

    "abstract": "The human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 is a prototypical RNA-binding protein essential for regulating a wide range of post-transcriptional events in cells. As a multifunctional protein with a key role in RNA metabolism, deregulation of its functions has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, tumor aggressiveness, and chemoresistance, which has fuelled efforts to develop novel therapeutics that modulate its RNA-binding activities. Here, using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and graph neural network pocket predictions, we showed that hnRNPA1 N-terminal RNA-binding domain (unwinding protein 1 [UP1]) contains several cryptic pockets capable of binding small molecules. To identify chemical entities for the development of potent drug candidates and experimentally validate identified druggable hotspots, we carried out a large fragment screening on UP1 protein crystals. Our screen identified 36 hits that extensively sample UP1 functional regions involved in RNA recognition and binding as well as map hotspots onto novel protein interaction surfaces. We observed a wide range of ligand-induced conformational variation by stabilization of dynamic protein regions. Our high-resolution structures, the first of an hnRNP in complex with a fragment or small molecule, provide rapid routes for the rational development of a range of different inhibitors and chemical tools for studying molecular mechanisms of hnRNPA1-mediated splicing regulation.",

The N-terminal kinase domain of diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinase (PPIP5K) generates the messenger 1,5-InsP<sub>8</sub>, the C-terminal phosphatase domain catalyzes PP-InsP breakdown. The balance between kinase and phosphatase activities regulates 1,5-InsP<sub>8</sub> levels. Here, we present crystal structures of the apo and substrate-bound PPIP5K phosphatase domain from S. cerevisiae (ScVip1<sup>PD</sup>). ScVip1<sup>PD</sup> is a phytase-like inositol 1-pyrophosphate histidine phosphatase with two conserved catalytic motifs. The enzyme has a strong preference for 1,5-InsP<sub>8</sub> and is inhibited by inorganic phosphate. It contains an \u03b1-helical insertion domain stabilized by a structural Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding site, and a unique GAF domain that channels the substrate to the active site. Mutations that alter the active site, restrict the movement of the GAF domain, or change the substrate channel's charge inhibit the enzyme activity in vitro, and Arabidopsis VIH2 in planta.

This study presents the systematic design of quinoline-containing SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PL<sup>pro</sup>) inhibitors as potential oral antiviral drug candidates. By leveraging the recently discovered Val70<sup>Ub</sup> binding site in PL<sup>pro</sup>, we designed a series of quinoline analogs demonstrating potent PL<sup>pro</sup> inhibition and antiviral activity. Notably, the X-ray crystal structures of 6 lead compounds reveal that the 2-aryl substitution can occupy either the Val70<sup>Ub</sup> site as expected or the BL2 groove in a flipped orientation. The in vivo lead Jun13296 exhibits favorable pharmacokinetic properties and potent inhibition against SARS-CoV-2 variants and nirmatrelvir-resistant mutants. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, oral treatment with Jun13296 significantly improves survival, reduces body weight loss and lung viral titers, and prevents lung tissue damage. These results underscore the potential of quinoline PL<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors as promising oral SARS-CoV-2 antiviral candidates, instilling hope for the future of SARS-CoV-2 treatment.",

In this study, we narrowed 651 pesticide-related compounds down to 14 possible TTR binders through in silico screening; subsequent in vitro analysis revealed that 7 of them exhibited amyloid fibril formation inhibition activity. The herbicide components bromoxynil (<b>6</b>) and ioxynil (<b>21</b>) showed especially high ligand efficiency and efficiently inhibited amyloid fibril formation of amyloidogenic V30M-TTR. Additionally, aclonifen (<b>9</b>) exhibited moderate fibril formation inhibition activity, but showed selective binding to TTR comparable to that of tafamidis. While improvement is needed to the selective TTR-binding or fibril formation inhibition activity, the compounds identified herein are promising lead candidates for the development of ATTRv amyloidosis therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Radiation-resistant bacteria are of great application potential in various fields, including bioindustry and bioremediation of radioactive waste. However, how radiation-resistant bacteria combat against invading phages is seldom addressed. Here, we present a series of crystal structures of a sensor and an effector of the cyclic oligonucleotide-based anti-phage signaling system (CBASS) from a radioresistant bacterium Deinococcus wulumuqiensis. We found that the sensor CD-NTase enzyme, DwCdnB, can bind all four ribonucleotides and synthesize a variety of cyclic di-nucleotides, including the novel second messenger 3'3'-cyclic di-CMP. Crystal structures of DwCdnB in complex with ATP and dATP provide structural explanations for specific recognition of ribonucleotides via metal coordination with ribose 2'-OH. Crystal structures of DwCdnB in complex with purine and/or pyrimidine nucleotides in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> revealed similar binding modes; however, in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, the UTP/CTP rotates and flips into the donor pocket and make extensive contacts with additional five residues, suggesting essential role of Mn<sup>2+</sup> for catalytic production of cyclic di-pyrimidines. Finally, structural analysis of the downstream effector DwCap5 further provides a structural explanation for its non-specific recognition of a broad range of cyclic di-nucleotides. In sum, this work provides key structural insights into the immune mechanisms of radioresistant bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Structural information on channelrhodopsins' mechanism of light-gated ion conductance is scarce, limiting its engineering as optogenetic tools. Here, we use single-particle cryo-electron microscopy of peptidisc-incorporated protein samples to determine the structures of the slow-cycling mutant C110A of kalium channelrhodopsin 1 from Hyphochytrium catenoides (HcKCR1) in the dark and upon laser flash excitation. Upon photoisomerization of the retinal chromophore, the retinylidene Schiff base NH-bond reorients from the extracellular to the cytoplasmic side. This switch triggers a series of side chain reorientations and merges intramolecular cavities into a transmembrane K<sup>+</sup> conduction pathway. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm K<sup>+</sup> flux through the illuminated state but not through the resting state. The overall displacement between the closed and the open structure is small, involving mainly side chain rearrangements. Asp105 and Asp116 play a key role in K<sup>+</sup> conductance. Structure-guided mutagenesis and patch-clamp analysis reveal the roles of the pathway-forming residues in channel gating and selectivity.",

    "abstract": "Although biocatalysis offers complementary or alternative approaches to traditional synthetic methods, the limited range of available enzymatic reactions currently poses challenges in synthesizing a diverse array of desired compounds. Consequently, there is a significant demand for developing novel biocatalytic processes to enable reactions that were previously unattainable. Herein, we report the discovery and subsequent protein engineering of a unique halohydrin dehalogenase to develop a biocatalytic platform for enantioselective formation and ring-opening of oxetanes. This biocatalytic platform, exhibiting high efficiency, excellent enantioselectivity, and broad scopes, facilitates the preparative-scale synthesis of chiral oxetanes and a variety of chiral \u03b3-substituted alcohols. Additionally, both the enantioselective oxetane formation and ring-opening processes are proven scalable for large-scale transformations at high substrate concentrations, and can be integrated efficiently in a one-pot, one-catalyst cascade system. This work expands the enzymatic toolbox for non-natural reactions and will promote further exploration of the catalytic repertoire of halohydrin dehalogenases in synthetic and pharmaceutical chemistry.",

    "abstract": "The mycobacterial ABC transporter IrtAB features an ABC exporter fold, yet it imports iron-charged siderophores called mycobactins. Here, we present extensive cryo-EM analyses and DEER measurements, revealing that IrtAB alternates between an inward-facing and an outward-occluded conformation, but does not sample an outward-facing conformation. When IrtAB is locked in its outward-occluded conformation in nanodiscs, mycobactin is bound in the middle of the lipid bilayer at a membrane-facing crevice opening at the heterodimeric interface. Mutations introduced at the crevice abrogate mycobactin import and in corresponding structures, the crevice is collapsed. A conserved triple histidine motif coordinating a zinc ion is present below the mycobactin binding site. Substitution of these histidine residues with alanine results in a decoupled transporter, which hydrolyzes ATP, but lost its capacity to import mycobactins. Our data suggest that IrtAB imports mycobactin via a credit-card mechanism in a transport cycle that is coupled to the presence of zinc.",

    "abstract": "Multidrug ABC transporters harness the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to translocate substrates out of the cell and detoxify them. While this involves a well-accepted alternating access mechanism, molecular details of this interplay are still elusive. Rhodamine6G binding on a catalytic inactive mutant of the homodimeric multidrug ABC transporter BmrA triggers a cooperative binding of ATP on the two identical nucleotide-binding-sites, otherwise michaelian. Here, we investigate this asymmetric behavior via a structural-enzymology approach, solving cryoEM structures of BmrA at defined ATP ratios, highlighting the plasticity of BmrA as it undergoes the transition from inward to outward facing conformations. Analysis of continuous heterogeneity within cryoEM data and structural dynamics, reveals that Rhodamine6G narrows the conformational spectrum explored by the nucleotide-binding domains. We observe the same behavior for the other drug H\u0153chst33342. Following on these findings, the effect of drug-binding showed an ATPase stimulation and a maximal transport activity of the wild-type protein at the concentration-range where the cooperative transition occurs. Altogether, these findings provide a description of the influence of drug binding on the ATP-binding sites through a change in conformational dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Protein mycoloylation is a newly characterized post-translational modification (PTM) specifically found in Corynebacteriales, an order of bacteria that includes numerous human pathogens. Their envelope is composed of a unique outer membrane, the so-called mycomembrane made of very-long chain fatty acids, named mycolic acids. Recently, some mycomembrane proteins including PorA have been unambiguously shown to be covalently modified with mycolic acids in the model organism Corynebacterium glutamicum by a mechanism that relies on the mycoloyltransferase MytC. This PTM represents the first example of protein O-acylation in prokaryotes and the first example of protein modification by mycolic acid. Through the design and synthesis of trehalose monomycolate (TMM) analogs, we prove that i) MytC is the mycoloyltransferase directly involved in this PTM, ii) TMM, but not trehalose dimycolate (TDM), is a suitable mycolate donor for PorA mycoloylation, iii) MytC is able to discriminate between an acyl and a mycoloyl chain in\u00a0vitro unlike other trehalose mycoloyltransferases. We also solved the structure of MytC acyl-enzyme obtained with a soluble short TMM analogs which constitutes the first mycoloyltransferase structure covalently linked to an authentic mycolic acid moiety. These data highlight the great conformational flexibility of the active site of MytC during the reaction cycle and pave the way for a better understanding of the catalytic mechanism of all members of the mycoloyltransferase family including the essential Antigen85 enzymes in Mycobacteria.",

    "abstract": "Changing environmental conditions necessitate rapid adaptation of cytoplasmic and nuclear volumes. We use the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, known for its ability to tolerate extreme changes in osmolarity, to assess which role nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) play in achieving nuclear volume adaptation and relieving mechanical stress. We capitalize on the unique properties of D.\u00a0discoideum to quantify fluid flow across NPCs. D.\u00a0discoideum has an elaborate NPC structure in situ. Its dilation state affects NPC permeability for nucleocytosolic flow. Based on mathematical concepts adapted from hydrodynamics, we conceptualize this phenomenon as porous flow across NPCs, which is distinct from canonically characterized modes of nucleocytoplasmic transport because of its dependence on pressure. Viral NPC blockage decreased nucleocytosolic flow. Our results may be relevant for any biological conditions that entail rapid nuclear size adaptation, including metastasizing cancer cells, migrating cells, or differentiating tissues.",

    "abstract": "The \u03b1-helix is an abundant and functionally important element of protein secondary structure, which has motivated intensive efforts toward chemical strategies to stabilize helical folds. One such method is the incorporation of non-canonical backbone composition through an additional methyl substituent at the C<sub>\u03b1</sub> atom. Examples of monomers include the achiral 2-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) with geminal dimethyl substitution and chiral analogues with one methyl and one non-methyl substituent. While Aib and chiral C<sub>\u03b1</sub>-Me residues are both established helix promoting moieties, their comparative ability in this regard has not been quantitatively investigated. Addressing this gap would help to inform the use of these building blocks in the construction of peptide and protein mimetics as well as provide fundamental insights into consequences of backbone methylation on folding. Here, we report a quantitative comparison of the impacts of Aib and chiral \u03b1Me residues on the high-resolution folded structure and folding thermodynamics of a small helical protein. These results reveal a synergistic stabilizing effect arising from the presence of C<sub>\u03b1</sub> methylation in conjunction with a C<sub>\u03b1</sub> stereocenter.",

Two Pt binding sites were identified in both molecules of the adduct present in the crystal asymmetric unit: Pt binds close to the side chains of Met256 and Met499 at the N- and C-lobe, respectively. In the crystal structure, the cisplatin moiety bound to Met256 also interacts with Ser616 from a symmetry related molecule. Structural analyses, together with in solution data, demonstrate that the presence of iron does not affect the ability of hTF to bind cisplatin and that the cisplatin binding does not significantly alter the overall conformation of the different forms of the protein that remain able to form a complex with the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1). These data suggest that the different hTF forms can be used as nanocarriers for targeted (combined) metallodrug delivery.",

Although all components have been individually characterized, the intact PDHc structure remains unclear, hampering our understanding of its composition and dynamical catalytic mechanisms. Here, we report the in-situ architecture of intact mammalian PDHc by cryo-electron tomography. The organization of peripheral E1 and E3 components varies substantially among the observed PDHcs, with an average of 21 E1 surrounding each PDHc core, and up to 12 E3 locating primarily along the pentagonal openings. In addition, we observed dynamic interactions of the substrate translocating lipoyl domains (LDs) with both E1 and E2, and the interaction interfaces were further analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations. By revealing intrinsic dynamics of PDHc peripheral compositions, our findings indicate a distinctive activity regulation mechanism, through which the number of E1, E3 and functional LDs may be coordinated to meet constantly changing demands of metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Protein purification is essential in protein biochemistry, structural biology, and protein design, enabling the determination of protein structures, the study of biological mechanisms, and the characterization of both natural and de novo designed proteins. However, standard purification strategies often encounter challenges, such as unintended co-purification of contaminants alongside the target protein. This issue is particularly problematic for self-assembling protein nanomaterials, where unexpected geometries may reflect novel assembly states, cross-contamination, or native proteins originating from the expression host. Here, we used an automated structure-to-sequence pipeline to first identify an unknown co-purifying protein found in several purified designed protein samples. By integrating cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM), ModelAngelo's sequence-agnostic model-building, and Protein BLAST, we identified the contaminant as dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (DLST). This identification was validated through comparisons with DLST structures in the Protein Data Bank, AlphaFold 3 predictions based on the DLST sequence from our E. coli expression vector, and traditional biochemical methods. The identification informed subsequent modifications to our purification protocol, which successfully excluded DLST from future preparations. To explore the potential broader utility of this approach, we benchmarked four computational methods for DLST identification across varying resolution ranges. This study demonstrates the successful application of a structure-to-sequence protein identification workflow, integrating Cryo-EM, ModelAngelo, Protein BLAST, and AlphaFold 3 predictions, to identify and ultimately help guide the\u00a0removal of DLST from sample purification efforts. It highlights the potential of combining Cryo-EM with AI-driven tools for accurate protein identification and addressing purification challenges across diverse contexts in protein science.",

    "abstract": "The inherent antigen cross-reactivity of the T cell receptor (TCR) is balanced by high specificity. Surprisingly, TCR specificity often manifests in ways not easily interpreted from static structures. Here we show that TCR discrimination between an HLA-A*03:01 (HLA-A3)-restricted public neoantigen and its wild-type (WT) counterpart emerges from distinct motions within the HLA-A3 peptide binding groove that vary with the identity of the peptide's first primary anchor. These motions create a dynamic gate that, in the presence of the WT peptide, impedes a large conformational change required for TCR binding. The neoantigen is insusceptible to this limiting dynamic, and, with the gate open, upon TCR binding the central tryptophan can transit underneath the peptide backbone to the opposing side of the HLA-A3 peptide binding groove. Our findings thus reveal a novel mechanism driving TCR specificity for a cancer neoantigen that is rooted in the dynamic and allosteric nature of peptide/MHC-I binding grooves, with implications for resolving long-standing and often confounding questions about T cell specificity.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the skeletal isoform of the ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) pose grave risks during anesthesia or treatment with succinylcholine muscle relaxants. These can trigger a potentially lethal malignant hyperthermia (MH) episode via intracellular calcium increase mainly from RyR1 channel leakage. Dantrolene is the only known treatment option to prevent death. The main target of dantrolene is RyR1; however, little is known about the mechanism of inhibition. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of dantrolene bound to the severe MH Y522S RyR1 mutant in the closed and open states at 2.5-3.3\u00a0\u00c5 resolution revealed that the drug binds to the channel's cytoplasmic assembly, far from the ion gate, interacting with residues W882, W996, and R1000 in the P1 domain. The finding was validated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and [<sup>3</sup>H]ryanodine binding in wild-type (WT) and alanine mutants. Dantrolene reduced channel opening probability by restricting the central activation module, \"cooling down\" the primed conformation caused by the mutation.",

    "abstract": "Vaccination strategies against HIV-1 aim to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) using prime-boost regimens with HIV envelope (Env) immunogens. Epitope mapping has shown that early antibody responses are directed to easily accessible nonneutralizing epitopes on Env instead of bnAb epitopes. Autologously neutralizing antibody responses appear upon boosting, once immunodominant epitopes are saturated. Here, we use electron microscopy-based polyclonal epitope mapping (EMPEM) to elucidate how repeated immunization with HIV Env SOSIP immunogens results in the generation of Ab2\u03b1 anti-idiotypic antibodies in rabbits and rhesus macaques. We present the structures of six anti-immune complex antibodies and find that they target idiotopes composed of framework regions of antibodies bound to Env. Examination of cryo-electron microscopy density enabled prediction of sequences for an anti-immune complex antibody, the paratope of which is enriched with aromatic amino acids. This work sheds light on current vaccine development efforts for HIV, as well as for other pathogens in which repeated exposure to antigen is required.",

    "abstract": "AMPylation is a post-translational modification (PTM) whereby adenosine monophosphate (AMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is transferred onto protein hydroxyl groups of serine, threonine, or tyrosine. Recently, an actin-dependent AMPylase namely LnaB from the bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila was found to AMPylate phosphate groups of phosphoribosylated ubiquitin and Src family kinases. LnaB represents an evolutionarily distinct family of AMPylases with conserved active site Ser-His-Glu residues. Here, we capture the structure of the LnaB-actin complex in a putative intermediate state via single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and find that the catalytic histidine of LnaB is covalently attached to AMP through a phosphoramidate linkage at the N\u03b41 atom. This observation provides direct structural evidence of histidine AMPylation as a PTM and implies the possibility of covalent catalysis in LnaB-mediated AMPylation, a mechanism distinct from known AMPylases. Subsequent biochemical studies confirm the observed AMP binding site and provide additional insights into the catalytic properties of LnaB. Together, our work highlights the power of cryo-EM in capturing labile PTMs and transient species during enzymatic reactions, while opening new avenues of mechanistic investigation into the LnaB family.",

Here, we present a 2.21 \u00c5 cryo-EM structure of the thermostable light-harvesting 1-reaction center (LH1-RC) complex from <i>Blc. tepida</i>. The LH1 ring comprises 16 circularly arranged \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3-subunits plus one \u03b1\u03b2-subunit that surround the RC complex composed of C-, H-, L-, and M-subunits. In a comparative study, the <i>Blc. tepida</i> LH1-RC showed numerous electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions both within the LH1 complex itself and between the LH1 and the RC complexes that are absent from the LH1-RC complex of its mesophilic counterpart, <i>Blc. viridis</i>. These additional interactions result in a tightly packed LH1-RC architecture with a reduced accessible surface area per volume that enhances the thermal stability of the <i>Blc. tepida</i> complex and allows the light reactions of photosynthesis to proceed at hot spring temperatures. Moreover, based on high-resolution structural information combined with spectroscopic evidence, the unique photosynthetic property of the <i>Blc. tepida</i> LH1-RC\u2500absorption of energy-poor near-infrared light beyond 1000 nm\u2500can be attributed to strong hydrogen-bonding interactions between the C3-acetyl C\u2550O of the LH1 BChl <i>b</i> and two LH1 \u03b1-Trp residues, structural rigidity of the LH1, and the enhanced exciton coupling of the LH1 BChls of this thermophile.",

    "abstract": "Kinetoplastids are a clade of eukaryotic protozoans that include human parasitic pathogens like trypanosomes and Leishmania species. In these organisms, protein-coding genes are transcribed as polycistronic pre-mRNAs, which need to be processed by the coupled action of trans-splicing and polyadenylation to yield monogenic mature mRNAs. During trans-splicing, a universal RNA sequence, the spliced leader RNA (SL RNA) mini-exon, is added to the 5'-end of each mRNA. The 5'-end of this mini-exon carries a hypermethylated cap structure and is bound by a trypanosomatid-specific cap-binding complex (CBC). The function of three of the kinetoplastid CBC subunits is unknown, but an essential role in cap-binding and trans-splicing has been suggested. Here, we report cryo-EM structures that reveal the molecular architecture of the Trypanosoma brucei CBC (TbCBC) complex. We find that TbCBC interacts with two distinct features of the SL RNA. The TbCBP20 subunit interacts with the m<sup>7</sup>G cap while TbCBP66 recognizes double-stranded portions of the SL RNA. Our findings pave the way for future research on mRNA maturation in kinetoplastids. Moreover, the observed structural similarities and differences between TbCBC and the mammalian cap-binding complex will be crucial for considering the potential of TbCBC as a target for anti-trypanosomatid drug development.",

Nevertheless, this resource-intensive process may be hindered by the unintended crystallization of contaminant proteins from the expression source. Here, the serendipitous discovery of two novel crystal forms and one new, high-resolution structure of carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2) from Escherichia coli that arose during a crystallization campaign for an unrelated target is reported. By comparing unit-cell parameters with those in the PDB, contaminants such as CA2 can be identified, preventing futile molecular-replacement attempts. Crystallographers can use these new lattice parameters to diagnose CA2 contamination in similar experiments.",

    "abstract": "The genome of the mildly thermophilic hot spring purple sulfur bacterium, <i>Allochromatium</i> (<i>Alc</i>.) <i>tepidum</i>, contains a multigene <i>pufBA</i> family that encodes a series of \u03b1- and \u03b2-polypeptides, collectively forming a heterogeneous light-harvesting 1 (LH1) complex. The <i>Alc. tepidum</i> LH1, therefore, offers a unique model for studying an intermediate phenotype between phototrophic thermophilic and mesophilic bacteria, particularly regarding their LH1 <i>Qy</i> transition and moderately enhanced thermal stability. Of the 16 \u03b1-polypeptides in the <i>Alc. tepidum</i> LH1, six \u03b11 bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> to connect with \u03b21- or \u03b23-polypeptides in specific Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites. Here, we use the purple bacterium <i>Rhodospirillum rubrum</i> strain H2 as a host to express Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free <i>Alc. tepidum</i> LH1-only complexes composed of \u03b1- and \u03b2-polypeptides that either contain or lack the calcium-binding motif WxxDxI; purified preparations of each complex were then used to test how Ca<sup>2+</sup> affects their thermostability and spectral features. The cryo-EM structures of both complexes were closed circular rings consisting of 14 \u03b1\u03b2-polypeptides. The <i>Q<sub>y</sub></i> absorption maximum of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound LH1 (\u03b11/\u03b21 and \u03b11/\u03b23) was at 894 nm, while that of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free (\u03b12/\u03b21) was at 888 nm, indicating that Ca<sup>2+</sup> imparts a <i>Q<sub>y</sub></i> transition of 6 nm. Crucially for the ecological success of <i>Alc. tepidum</i>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound LH1 complexes were more thermostable than Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free complexes, indicating that calcium plays at least two major roles in photosynthesis by <i>Alc. tepidum</i>-improving photocomplex stability and modifying its spectrum.",

    "abstract": "The multi-step macroautophagy/autophagy process ends with the cargo-laden autophagosome fusing with the lysosome to deliver the materials to be degraded. The metazoan-specific autophagy factor EPG5 plays a crucial role in this step by enforcing fusion specificity and preventing mistargeting. How EPG5 exerts its critical function and how its deficiency leads to diverse phenotypes of the rare multi-system disorder Vici syndrome are not fully understood. Here, we report the first structure of human EPG5 (HsEPG5) determined by cryo-EM and AlphaFold2 modeling. Our structure revealed that HsEPG5 is constructed from helical bundles analogous to tethering factors in membrane trafficking pathways but contains a unique protruding thumb domain positioned adjacent to the atypical tandem LIR motifs involved in interaction with the GABARAP subfamily of Atg8-family proteins. Our NMR spectroscopic, molecular dynamics simulations and AlphaFold modeling studies showed that the HsEPG5 tandem LIR motifs only bind the canonical LIR docking site (LDS) on GABARAP without engaging in multivalent interaction. Our co-immunoprecipitation analysis further indicated that full-length HsEPG5-GABARAP interaction is mediated primarily by LIR1. Finally, our biochemical affinity isolation, X-ray crystallographic analysis, affinity measurement, and AlphaFold modeling demonstrated that this mode of binding is observed between <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> EPG-5 and its Atg8-family proteins LGG-1 and LGG-2. Collectively our work generated novel insights into the structural properties of EPG5 and how it potentially engages with the autophagosome to confer fusion specificity.<b>ABBREVIATIONS</b>: ATG: autophagy related; CSP: chemical shift perturbation; eGFP: enhanced green fluoresent protein; EM: electron microscopy; EPG5: ectopic P-granules 5 autophagy tethering factor; GST: glutathione S-transferase; HP: hydrophobic pocket; HSQC: heteronuclear single-quantum correlation; ITC: isothermal titration calorimetry; LDS: LC3 docking site; LIR: LC3-interacting region; MD: molecular dynamics; NMR: nuclear magnetic resonance; TEV: tobacco etch virus.",

They synthesize polypeptides using peptidyl carrier proteins that shuttle each amino acid through modular loading, modification and elongation<sup>2</sup> steps, and remain challenging to structurally characterize, owing in part to the inherent dynamics of their multi-domain and multi-modular architectures<sup>3</sup>. Here we have developed site-selective crosslinking probes to conformationally constrain and resolve the interactions between carrier proteins and their partner enzymatic domains<sup>4,5</sup>. We apply tetrazine click chemistry to trap the condensation of two carrier protein substrates within the active site of the condensation domain that unites the first two modules of tyrocidine biosynthesis and report the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of this complex. Together with the X-ray crystal structure of the first carrier protein crosslinked to its epimerization domain, these structures highlight captured intermodular recognition events and define the processive movement of a carrier protein from one catalytic step to the next. Characterization of these structural relationships remains central to understanding the molecular details of these unique synthetases and critically informs future synthetic biology design of these pathways.",

However, how both ligases recognize BACH1 under oxidative stress is unclear. In our study, we elucidate the mechanism by which FBXO22 recognizes a quaternary degron in a domain-swapped \u03b2-sheet of the BACH1 BTB dimer. Cancer-associated mutations and cysteine modifications destabilize the degron and impair FBXO22 binding but simultaneously expose an otherwise shielded degron in the dimer interface, allowing FBXL17 to recognize BACH1 as a monomer. These findings shed light on a ligase switch mechanism that enables post-translational regulation of BACH1 by complementary ligases depending on the stability of its BTB domain. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the oxidative stress response and may spur therapeutic approaches for targeting oxidative stress-related disorders and cancer.",

In normal neuronal progenitors, N-Myc undergoes rapid degradation, while, in MYCN-amplified NB cells, Aurora kinase A (Aurora-A) binds to and stabilizes N-Myc, resulting in elevated protein levels. Here, we demonstrate that targeted protein degradation of Aurora-A decreases N-Myc levels. A potent Aurora-A degrader, HLB-0532259 (compound 4), was developed from an Aurora-A-binding ligand that engages the Aurora-A/N-Myc complex. HLB-0532259 promotes the degradation of Aurora-A, which elicits concomitant N-Myc degradation, with nanomolar potency and excellent selectivity. HLB-0532259 surpasses the cellular efficacy of established allosteric Aurora-A inhibitors, exhibits favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and elicits tumor reduction in a murine xenograft NB model. This study broadly delineates a strategy for targeting \"undruggable\" proteins that are reliant on accessory proteins for cellular stabilization.",

    "abstract": "Histone lysine lactylation is a physiologically and pathologically relevant epigenetic pathway that can be stimulated by the Warburg effect-associated L-lactate. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which cells use L-lactate to generate lactyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and how this process is regulated remains unknown. Here, we report the identification of guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-specific SCS (GTPSCS) as a lactyl-CoA synthetase in the nucleus. The mechanism was elucidated through the crystallographic structure of GTPSCS in complex with L-lactate, followed by mutagenesis experiments. GTPSCS translocates into the nucleus and interacts with p300 to elevate histone lactylation but not succinylation. This process depends on a nuclear localization signal in the GTPSCS G1 subunit and acetylation at G2 subunit residue K73, which mediates the interaction with p300. GTPSCS/p300 collaboration synergistically regulates histone H3K18la and GDF15 expression, promoting glioma proliferation and radioresistance. GTPSCS represents the inaugural enzyme to catalyze lactyl-CoA synthesis for epigenetic histone lactylation and regulate oncogenic gene expression in glioma.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) recognize specific bases within their DNA-binding motifs, with each base contributing nearly independently to total binding energy. However, the energetic contributions of particular dinucleotides can deviate strongly from the additive approximation, indicating that some TFs can specifically recognize DNA dinucleotides. Here we solved high-resolution (<1\u2009\u00c5) structures of MYF5 and BARHL2 bound to DNAs containing sets of dinucleotides that have different affinities to the proteins. The dinucleotides were recognized either enthalpically, by an extensive water network that connects the adjacent bases to the TF, or entropically, by a hydrophobic patch that maintained interfacial water mobility. This mechanism confers differential temperature sensitivity to the optimal sites, with implications for thermal regulation of gene expression. Our results uncover the enigma of how TFs can recognize more complex local features than mononucleotides and demonstrate that water-mediated recognition is important for predicting affinities of macromolecules from their sequence.",

The YhaJ-involving cells have been exploited for whole-cell biosensors of soil-buried landmines. Such biosensors would decrease the damage to personnel who approach landmine fields. By the structure determination of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of YhaJ and the structure-guided mutagenesis, we found that the mutation increasing the DNA binding affinity decreases the signal leakage in the absence of an effector, resulting in a significant enhancement of the response ratio for the DNT metabolite detection. The decrease in signal leakage explains the LysR-type transcriptional regulators' (LTTRs') unique mechanism of signal absence repression by choosing between two different activation binding sites. We showed that the biosensor performance enhancement by the decrease in signal leakage could combine with the previous signal-enhancing mutations. The novel mechanism of performance enhancement of YhaJ shed light on bacterial transcription regulation and the optimization of biosensors that involve the large family of LTTRs.",

    "abstract": "The LutR protein represses the transcription of genes encoding enzymes for the utilization of l-lactate in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> through binding to a specific DNA region. In this study, we employed oligonucleotide probes modified by viscosity-sensitive tetramethylated thiophene-BODIPY fluorophores to investigate the impact of selected metabolites on the LutR-DNA complex. Our goal was to identify the effector molecule whose binding alters the protein-DNA affinity, thereby enabling gene transcription. The designed DNA probes exhibited distinctive responses to the binding and release of the protein, characterized by significant alterations in fluorescence lifetime. Through this method, we have identified l-lactate as the sole metabolite exerting a substantial modulating effect on the protein-DNA interaction and thus confirmed its role as an effector molecule. Moreover, we showed that our approach was able to follow conformation changes affecting affinity, which were not captured by other methods commonly used to study the protein-DNA interaction, such as electro-mobility shift assays and florescence anisotropy binding studies. This work underlines the potential of environment-sensitive fluorophore-linked nucleotide modifications, <i>i.e.</i> dC<sup>TBdp</sup>, for studying the dynamics and subtle changes of protein-DNA interactions.",

Here we report the structure and function of a bacterial WTAs rhamnosyltransferase, RmlT, strictly required for L. monocytogenes WTAs rhamnosylation. In particular, we demonstrated that RmlT transfers rhamnose from dTDP-L-rhamnose to naked WTAs, and that specificity towards TDP-rhamnose is not determined by its binding affinity. Structures of RmlT with and without its substrates showed that this enzyme is a dimer, revealed the residues responsible for interaction with the substrates and that the catalytic residue pre-orients the acceptor substrate towards the nucleophilic attack to the sugar. Additionally, the structures provided indications for two potential interaction pathways for the long WTAs on the surface of RmlT. Finally, we confirmed that WTAs glycosyltransferases are promising targets for next-generation strategies against Gram-positive pathogens by showing that inactivation of the RmlT catalytic activity results in a decreased infection in vivo.",

Cells counteract loss of basal ROS via the reductive stress response, but the identity and biochemical activity of ROS sensed by this pathway remain unknown. Here, we show that the central enzyme of the reductive stress response, the E3 ligase Cullin 2-FEM1 homolog B (CUL2<sup>FEM1B</sup>), specifically acts at mitochondrial TOM complexes, where it senses ROS produced by complex III of the electron transport chain (ETC). ROS depletion during times of low ETC activity triggers the localized degradation of CUL2<sup>FEM1B</sup> substrates, which sustains mitochondrial import and ensures the biogenesis of the rate-limiting ETC complex IV. As complex III yields most ROS when the ETC outpaces metabolic demands or oxygen availability, basal ROS are sentinels of mitochondrial activity that help cells adjust their ETC to changing environments, as required for cell differentiation and survival.",

    "abstract": "Left-handed G-quadruplexes (LHG4s) belong to a class of recently discovered noncanonical DNA structures under the larger umbrella of G-quadruplex DNAs (G4s). The biological relevance of these structures and their ability to be targeted with classical G4 ligands is\u00a0underexplored. Here, we explore whether the putative LHG4 DNA sequence from the SLC2A1 oncogene promoter maintains its left-handed characteristics upon addition of nucleotides in the 5'- and 3'-direction from its genomic context. We also investigate whether this sequence interacts with a well-established G4 binder, N-methylmesoporphyrin IX (NMM). We employed biophysical and X-ray structural studies to address these questions. Our results indicate that the sequence d[G(TGG)3TGA(TGG)4] (termed here as SLC) adopts a two-subunit, four-tetrad hybrid left-/right-handed G4 (LH/RHG4) topology. Addition of 5'-G or 5'-GG abolishes the left-handed fold in one subunit, while the addition of 3'-C or 3'-CA maintains the original fold. X-ray crystal structure analyses show that SLC maintains the same hybrid LH/RHG4 fold in the solid state and that NMM stacks onto the right-handed subunit of SLC. NMM binds to SLC with a 1:1 stoichiometry and a moderate-to-tight binding constant of 15 \u03bcM-1. This\u00a0work deepens our understanding of LHG4 structures and their binding with traditional G4 ligands.",

    "abstract": "Histone methyltransferase NSD2 (MMSET) overexpression in multiple myeloma (MM) patients plays an important role in the development of this disease subtype. Through the expansion of transcriptional activating H3K36me2 and the suppression of repressive H3K27me3 marks, NSD2 activates an aberrant set of genes that contribute to myeloma growth, adhesive and invasive activities. NSD2 transcriptional activity also depends on its non-catalytic domains, which facilitate its recruitment to chromatin through histone binding. In this study, using NMR, ITC and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the tandem PHD domain of NSD2 (PHDVC5HCHNSD2) is a combinatorial reader of unmodified histone H3K4 and tri-methylated H3K27 (H3K27me3). This is the first PHD tandem cassette known to decode the methylation status of H3K27. Importantly, in a NSD2-dependent MM cellular model, we show that expression of NSD2 mutants, engineered to disrupt the interaction between H3K27me3 and PHDVC5HCH, display in comparison to wild-type NSD2: incomplete loss of H3K27 methylation throughout the genome, decreased activation of adhesive properties and cell adhesion genes, and a decrease of the corresponding H3K27ac signal at promoters. Collectively, these data suggest that the PHDVC5HCH domain of NSD2 plays an important role in modulating gene expression and chromatin modification, providing new opportunities for pharmacological intervention.",

    "abstract": "Xeno nucleic acids (XNAs) are unnatural analogues of the natural nucleic acids in which the canonical ribose or deoxyribose rings are replaced with alternative sugars, congener structures or even open-ring configurations. The expanding repertoire of XNAs holds significant promise for diverse applications in molecular biology as well as diagnostics and therapeutics. Key advantages of XNAs over natural nucleic acids include their enhanced biostability, superior target affinity and (in some cases) catalytic activity. Natural systems generally lack the mechanisms to transcribe, reverse transcribe or replicate XNAs. This limitation has been overcome through the directed evolution of nucleic acid-modifying enzymes, especially polymerases (pols)\u00a0and reverse transcriptases (RTs). Despite these advances, the mechanisms by which synthetic RT enzymes read these artificial genetic polymers remain largely unexplored, primarily due to a scarcity of structural information. This study unveils first structural insights into an evolved thermostable DNA pol\u00a0interacting with the XNA 1,5-anhydrohexitol nucleic acid (HNA), revealing unprecedented HNA nucleotide conformations within a ternary complex with the enzyme. These findings not only deepen our understanding of HNA to DNA reverse transcription but also set the stage for future advancements of this and similar enzymes through deliberate design.",

    "abstract": "Infections caused by gram-negative pathogens continue to be a major risk to human health because of the innate antibiotic resistance endowed by their unique cell membrane architecture. Nature has developed an elegant solution to target gram-negative strains, namely by conjugating toxic antibiotic warheads to a suitable carrier to facilitate the active import of the drug to a specific target organism. Microcin C7 (McC) is a Trojan horse peptide-conjugated antibiotic that specifically targets enterobacteria by exploiting active import through oligopeptide transport systems. Here, we characterize the molecular mechanism of McC recognition by YejA, the solute binding protein of the <i>Escherichia coli</i> oligopeptide transporter. Structure-guided mutational and functional analysis elucidates the determinants of substrate recognition. We demonstrate that the peptide carrier can serve as a passport for the entry of molecules that are otherwise not taken into <i>E. coli</i> cells. We show that peptide conjugation can remodel the antibiotic spectrum of clinically relevant parent compounds. Bioinformatics analysis reveals a broad distribution of YejA-like transporters in only the Proteobacteria, underscoring the potential for the development of Trojan horse antibiotics that are actively imported into such gram-negative bacteria.",

Consequently, understanding the structural intricacies of proteins within pathologically affected tissues often relies on mass spectrometry and proteomic analysis. Here, we utilized cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) and the Build and Retrieve (BaR) method to investigate protein complexes' structural characteristics such as post-translational modification, active site occupancy, and arrested conformational state in Alzheimer's disease (AD) using brain lysate from a rat model (TgF344-AD). Our findings reveal novel insights into the architecture of these complexes, corroborated through mass spectrometry analysis. Interestingly, it has been shown that the dysfunction of these protein complexes extends beyond AD, implicating them in cancer, as well as other neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and schizophrenia. By elucidating these structural details, our work not only enhances our understanding of disease pathology but also suggests new avenues for future approaches in therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Marine brown algae produce the highly recalcitrant polysaccharide fucoidan, contributing to long-term oceanic carbon storage and climate regulation. Fucoidan is degraded by specialized heterotrophic bacteria, which promote ecosystem function and global carbon turnover using largely uncharacterized mechanisms. Here, we isolate and study two Planctomycetota strains from the microbiome associated with the alga Fucus spiralis, which grow efficiently on chemically diverse fucoidans. One of the strains appears to internalize the polymer, while the other strain degrades it extracellularly. Multi-omic approaches show that fucoidan breakdown is mediated by the expression of divergent polysaccharide utilization loci, and endo-fucanases of family GH168 are strongly upregulated during fucoidan digestion. Enzymatic assays and structural biology studies reveal how GH168 endo-fucanases degrade various fucoidan cores from brown algae, assisted by auxiliary hydrolytic enzymes. Overall, our results provide insights into fucoidan processing mechanisms in macroalgal-associated bacteria.",

Here, we solved glutamate- and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-bound Best2 structures, which delineate an intracellular glutamate binding site and an extracellular GABA binding site on Best2, respectively, identified extracellular GABA as a permeable activator of Best2, and elucidated the co-regulation of Best2 by glutamate, GABA and glutamine synthetase in vivo. We further identified multiple small molecules as activators of the bestrophin channels.

    "abstract": "Pairing center (PC) on each chromosome of Caenorhabditis elegans is crucial for homolog pairing and initiating synapsis. Within each PC, clusters of 11/12\u2009bp DNA motif recruit one of four paralogous meiosis-specific proteins: ZIM-1, ZIM-2, ZIM-3, or HIM-8. However, the mechanistic basis underlying the specificity of ZIM/HIM-8-PC DNA interaction remains elusive. Here, we describe crystal structures of HIM-8, ZIM-1 and ZIM-2 DNA binding domains (ZF1, ZF2 and CTD) in complex with their cognate PC DNA motifs, respectively. These structures demonstrated the ZF1-2-CTD folds as an integrated structural unit crucial for its DNA binding specificity. Base-specific DNA-contacting residues are exclusively distributed on ZF1-2 and highly conserved. Furthermore, the CTD potentially contributes to the conformational diversity of ZF1-2, imparting binding specificity to distinct PC DNA motifs. These findings shed light on the mechanism governing PC DNA motif recognition by ZIM/HIM-8 proteins, suggesting a co-evolution relationship between PC DNA motifs and ZF1-2-CTD in shaping the specific recognition.",

    "abstract": "Protein-inhibitor crystal structures aid medicinal chemists in efficiently improving the potency and selectivity of small-molecule inhibitors. It is estimated that a quarter of lead molecules in drug discovery projects are halogenated. Protein-inhibitor crystal structures have shed light on the role of halogen atoms in ligand binding. They form halogen bonds with protein atoms and improve shape complementarity of inhibitors with protein binding sites. However, specific radiation damage (SRD) can cause cleavage of carbon-halogen (C-<i>X</i>) bonds during X-ray diffraction data collection. This study shows significant C-<i>X</i> bond cleavage in protein-ligand structures of the therapeutic cancer targets B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) and heat shock protein 72 (HSP72) complexed with halogenated ligands, which is dependent on the type of halogen and chemical structure of the ligand. The study found that metrics used to evaluate the fit of the ligand to the electron density deteriorated with increasing X-ray dose, and that SRD eliminated the anomalous signal from brominated ligands. A point of diminishing returns is identified, where collecting highly redundant data reduces the anomalous signal that may be used to identify binding sites of low-affinity ligands or for experimental phasing. Straightforward steps are proposed to mitigate the effects of C-<i>X</i> bond cleavage on structures of proteins bound to halogenated ligands and to improve the success of anomalous scattering experiments.",

    "abstract": "Birnaviruses infect a broad range of vertebrate hosts, including fish and birds, and cause substantial economic losses in the fishery and livestock industries. The infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), an aquabirnavirus, specifically infects salmonids. While structures on T=1 subviral particles of the birnaviruses, including IPNV, have been studied, structural insights into the infectious T=13 particles have been limited to the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), an avibirnavirus. Determining the capsid structure of the T=13 particle of IPNV is crucial for advancing knowledge of its antigenicity, capsid assembly, and possible functional structures. Here, the capsid structure of the IPNV L5 strain has been determined at a resolution of 2.75 \u00c5. The overall structure resembles the T=13 IBDV structure, with notable differences in the surface loops on the P domain of the VP2 capsid protein essential for antigenicity and virulence. Additionally, previously undescribed structural features have been identified, including the C-terminal regions of the VP2 subunits within the pentagonal assembly unit at each 5-fold axis, which interlock with adjacent VP2 subunits. This interlocking, together with class-averaged projections of triangular and pentagonal units, suggests that the pentagonal unit formation could be important for a correct T=13 particle assembly, preventing the formation of T=1 subviral particles. Furthermore, positively charged residues in obstructed capsid pores at each 5-fold axis are speculated to facilitate intraparticle genome synthesis of IPNV.IMPORTANCEAquabirnaviruses cause deadly infectious diseases in salmonid fish, posing significant challenges for both wild and farmed fish populations. The most prevalent aquabirnavirus worldwide is the infectious pancreatic necrosis virus, whose multifunctional capsid is critical to its infection, replication, and maturation. Previously, research has focused on the structure of the virus' non-infectious subviral capsid. In this study, however, the first structure of the large, infectious, and functional form of the capsid has been determined. This new capsid structure reveals functional motifs that were previously unclear in the non-infectious capsid. These motifs are believed to be essential for the virus' replication and particle assembly, making them promising targets for developing strategies to control virus proliferation.",

Most photoreceptors sense blue or red light, but the recent discovery of the cobalamin-dependent photoreceptor, CarH, has expanded the wavelength range of photoreception to other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum to include the green light region. Further identification of cobalamin-dependent green light-sensitive photoreceptors has been hampered owing to poor annotation of the light responsiveness of cobalamin-binding domains (CBDs) in public databases. Here we report a computational workflow, SignatureFinder, that uses a combination of sequence and structural analyses to identify new light-responsive CBD-containing proteins. The light response of exemplar proteins containing the proposed signature were confirmed experimentally. A structural analysis of these new photoreceptors, including the crystal structure of a new CBD domain, highlights how the signature elements interact with the cobalamin chromophore to sense light. Database mining of 128\u2009000 CBD-containing sequences using the identified signature revealed more diverse CBD-containing photoreceptors, thereby expanding the family of green-light photoreceptors. A SignatureFinder web server is available (https://enzymeevolver.com) for wider applications, including the identification of signature sequences of other biological ligands of interest.",

    "abstract": "N<sup>\u03c9</sup>-hydroxy-l-arginine amidinohydrolase (EC:3.5.3.25), an enzyme in the d-cycloserine (d-CS) biosynthetic pathway of Streptomyces lavendulae, catalyzes the hydrolysis of an arginase inhibitor, N<sup>\u03c9</sup>-hydroxy-l-arginine, to produce l-ornithine and hydroxyurea, despite being homologous to arginase. Like arginase, the enzyme (DcsB) possesses two manganese ions (Mn<sub>A</sub> and Mn<sub>B</sub>) essential for the enzymatic reaction at the bottom of the cavity formed within the molecule. However, one of the Mn<sub>A</sub> ligands in DcsB is Cys86, whereas the corresponding residues in arginase are histidine. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of Mn-free DcsB to elucidate the installation mechanism of the manganese ions. The flipping of the His111 residue after the formation of the coordination bond to the second manganese ion may facilitate the installation of Mn<sub>B</sub> and the closing of the cavity entrance to retain Mn<sub>A</sub> and Mn<sub>B</sub> at the active site. Copper ions, which are known to be a positive regulator of many secondary metabolites in Streptomyces species, were found to irreversibly inactivate the catalytic activity of DcsB. Mass spectrometric and crystallographic analyses of the Cu(II)-treated DcsB indicated that Cys86 is oxidized to sulfinic acid. The d-CS biosynthesis in the producing microorganism may be negatively regulated by the concentration of intracellular copper ions, which mediates the oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "Baculovirus is the most studied insect virus owing to a broad ecological distribution and ease of engineering for biotechnological applications. However, its structure and evolutionary place in the virosphere remain enigmatic. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we show that the nucleocapsid forms a covalently cross-linked helical tube protecting a highly compacted 134-kilobase pair DNA genome. The ends of the tube are sealed by the base and cap substructures, which share a 126-subunit hub but differ in components that promote actin tail-mediated propulsion and nuclear entry of the nucleocapsid, respectively. Unexpectedly, sensitive searches for hidden evolutionary links show that the morphogenetic machinery and conserved oral infectivity factors originated within the lineage of baculo-like viruses (class <i>Naldaviricetes</i>). The unique viral architecture and structural atlas of hallmark proteins firmly place these viruses into a separate new realm, the highest taxonomy rank, and provide a structural framework to expand their use as sustainable bioinsecticides and biomedical tools.",

    "abstract": "The phylum Apicomplexa comprises eukaryotic parasites that cause fatal diseases affecting millions of people and animals worldwide. Their mitochondrial genomes have been significantly reduced, leaving only three protein-coding genes and highly fragmented mitoribosomal rRNAs, raising challenging questions about mitoribosome composition, assembly and structure. Our study reveals how Toxoplasma gondii assembles over 40 mt-rRNA fragments using exclusively nuclear-encoded mitoribosomal proteins and three lineage-specific families of RNA-binding proteins. Among these are four proteins from the Apetala2/Ethylene Response Factor (AP2/ERF) family, originally known as transcription factors in plants and Apicomplexa, now repurposed as essential mitoribosome components. Cryo-EM analysis of the mitoribosome structure demonstrates how these AP2 proteins function as RNA binders to maintain mitoribosome integrity. The mitoribosome is also decorated with members of lineage-specific RNA-binding proteins belonging to RAP (RNA-binding domain abundant in Apicomplexa) proteins and HPR (heptatricopeptide repeat) families, highlighting the unique adaptations of these parasites. Solving the molecular puzzle of apicomplexan mitoribosome could inform the development of therapeutic strategies targeting organellar translation.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of novel variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to pose an ongoing challenge for global public health services, highlighting the urgent need for effective therapeutic interventions. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are a major therapeutic strategy for the treatment of COVID-19 and other viral diseases. In this study, we employed hybridoma technology to generate mAbs that target the BA.5 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Through a comprehensive screening process, we identified four mAbs capable of effectively neutralizing BA.5, XBB.1.16, and related variant infections <i>in vitro</i>, among which ORB10 was found to neutralize BA.5 variants with a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT<sub>50</sub>) of 8.7 ng/mL. Additionally, competitive binding assays, sequencing of heavy and light chain variable regions, and binding kinetics characterization provided insights into the epitopes and binding affinities of the identified mAbs. Moreover, <i>in vivo</i> experiments in the K18-hACE2 mouse model demonstrated the protective efficacy of ORB10 against both BA.5 and XBB.1.16 variants. Finally, cryo-electron microscopy structural analysis of the ORB10-RBD complex identified key residues involved in the antibody-antigen interactions, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms of neutralization and immune escape of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants from mAbs.<h4>Importance</h4>The ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the emergence of variants capable of evading immune responses elicited by natural infection and vaccination, especially the highly transmissible and immune-evasive Omicron variants. This study generated and characterized a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specifically targeting the RBD of the Omicron BA.5 variant, of which the ORB10 showed efficacy against Omicron BA.5 and XBB.1.16 variants both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Cryo-EM structural analysis further elucidated the binding epitope interactions and neutralization mechanism between ORB10 and the BA.5 RBD protein. This study enhances our understanding of antibody-mediated neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and provides valuable insights into the development of effective therapeutic strategies to combat ongoing SARS-CoV-2 variant infections.",

    "abstract": "The zinc-activated channel (ZAC) is an atypical mammalian cys-loop receptor (CLR) that is activated by zinc ions and protons, allowing cations to pass through. The molecular mechanism that ligands use to activate ZAC remains elusive. Here, we present three cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of human ZAC (hZAC) under different conditions. These three hZAC structures display highly similar conformations to one another, forming symmetrical homo-pentamers with a central ion-conduction pore. The hZAC protomer comprises an extracellular domain (ECD) and a transmembrane domain (TMD), sharing more structural similarity with anion-permeable CLRs, such as glycine receptors and type A \u03b3-aminobutyric acid receptors. Notably, hZAC possesses a distinctive C-tail that establishes a disulfide bond with the loop M2-M3 in the TMD and occupies what is typically the canonical neurotransmitter orthosteric site in other mammalian CLRs. Moreover, the tip of the cys-loop creates an unprecedented orthosteric site in hZAC. The binding of Zn<sup>2+</sup> triggers a conformational shift in the cys-loop, which presumably prompts the loop M2-M3 to move and open the channel gate. This study sheds light on the assembly of the channel, its structural features, and the process of signal transduction in hZAC.",

    "abstract": "Sabinene is a plant natural product with a distinctive strained [3.1.0] bicyclic ring system that is used commercially as a spicy and pine-like fragrance with citrus undertones. This unusual monoterpene has also been studied as an antifungal and anti-inflammatory agent as well as a next-generation biofuel. In order to understand the molecular determinants of [3.1.0] bicyclic ring formation in sabinene biosynthesis, we now report three X-ray crystal structures of sabinene synthase from Western red cedar, <i>Thuja plicata</i> (TpSS), with open and partially closed active site conformations at 2.21-2.72 \u00c5 resolution. We additionally report the complete biochemical characterization of sabinene synthase, including steady-state kinetics, active site mutagenesis, and product array profiling. The catalytic metal ion requirement is unexpectedly broad for a class I terpene cyclase: optimal catalytic activity was measured using Mn<sup>2+</sup> or Co<sup>2+</sup>, with more modest activity observed using Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Ni<sup>2+</sup>. Kinetic parameters were determined for both full-length TpSS and a deletion variant lacking the putative N-terminal plastidial targeting sequence, designated \u0394TpSS. Monoterpene product profiles for both indicated similar product arrays independent of the catalytic metal ion used, with sabinene comprising nearly 90% of the total products generated. Site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to probe the function of active site residues, and several mutants yielded altered product arrays. Most notably, the G458A substitution converted \u0394TpSS into a high-activity \u03b1-pinene synthase. \u03b1-Pinene contains a bicyclic [3.1.1] ring system; structural and mechanistic analyses suggest a molecular rationale for the reprogrammed transannulation reaction, leading to the alternative bicyclic product.",

    "abstract": "Ribosome-targeting antibiotics represent an important class of antimicrobial drugs. Chloramphenicol (Cm) is a well-studied ribosomal peptidyl transferase center (PTC) binder and growing evidence suggests that its inhibitory action depends on the sequence of the nascent peptide. How such selective inhibition on the molecular scale manifests on the cellular level remains unclear. Here, we use cryo-electron tomography to analyze the impact of Cm inside the bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae. By resolving the Cm-bound ribosomes to 3.0\u2009\u00c5, we elucidate Cm's coordination with natural nascent peptides and transfer RNAs in the PTC. We find that Cm leads to the accumulation of a number of translation elongation states, indicating ongoing futile accommodation cycles, and to extensive ribosome collisions. We, thus, suggest that, beyond its direct inhibition of protein synthesis, the action of Cm may involve the activation of cellular stress responses. This work exemplifies how in-cell structural biology can expand the understanding of mechanisms of action for extensively studied antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Zorya is a recently identified and widely distributed bacterial immune system that protects bacteria from viral (phage) infections. Three Zorya subtypes have been identified, each containing predicted membrane-embedded ZorA-ZorB (ZorAB) complexes paired with soluble subunits that differ among Zorya subtypes, notably ZorC and ZorD in type I Zorya systems<sup>1,2</sup>. Here we investigate the molecular basis of Zorya defence using cryo-electron microscopy, mutagenesis, fluorescence microscopy, proteomics and functional studies. We present cryo-electron microscopy structures of ZorAB and show that it shares stoichiometry and features of other 5:2 inner membrane ion-driven rotary motors. The ZorA<sub>5</sub>B<sub>2</sub> complex contains a dimeric ZorB peptidoglycan-binding domain and a pentameric \u03b1-helical coiled-coil tail made of ZorA that projects approximately 70\u2009nm into the cytoplasm. We also characterize the structure and function of the soluble Zorya components ZorC and ZorD, finding that they have DNA-binding and nuclease activity, respectively. Comprehensive functional and mutational analyses demonstrate that all Zorya components work in concert to protect bacterial cells against invading phages. We provide evidence that ZorAB operates as a proton-driven motor that becomes activated after sensing of phage invasion. Subsequently, ZorAB transfers the phage invasion signal through the ZorA cytoplasmic tail to recruit and activate the soluble ZorC and ZorD effectors, which facilitate the degradation of the phage DNA. In summary, our study elucidates the foundational mechanisms of Zorya function as an anti-phage defence system.",

We use biochemical and structural biology methods to investigate homologs from pathogenic microorganisms; Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii. We determined the X-ray crystal structures of IspE-inhibitor complexes and studied inhibitors' binding modes targeting the substrate pocket. The experimental results indicate the need for distinct inhibitor strategies due to structural differences among IspE homologs, particularly for A.\u00a0baumannii IspE, which displays a unique inhibitory profile due to a tighter hydrophobic subpocket in the substrate binding site. This study enhances our understanding of the MEP enzymes and sets the stage for structure-based drug design of selective inhibitors to combat pathogenic microorganisms.",

This complex comprises the scaffold protein ISCU2, the cysteine desulfurase subcomplex NFS1-ISD11-ACP1, the allosteric activator frataxin (FXN) and the electron donor ferredoxin-2 (FDX2). The structural interaction of FDX2 with the complex remains unclear. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of the human FDX2-bound core ISC complex showing that FDX2 and FXN compete for overlapping binding sites. FDX2 binds in either a 'distal' conformation, where its helix F interacts electrostatically with an arginine patch of NFS1, or a 'proximal' conformation, where this interaction tightens and the FDX2-specific C terminus binds to NFS1, facilitating the movement of the [2Fe-2S] cluster of FDX2 closer to the ISCU2 FeS cluster assembly site for rapid electron transfer. Structure-based mutational studies verify the contact areas of FDX2 within the core ISC complex.",

    "abstract": "The properties of Cas12a nucleases constrict the range of accessible targets and their applications. In this study, we applied ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) to a set of Cas12a orthologs from hydrobacteria to reconstruct a common ancestor, ReChb, characterized by near-PAMless targeting and the recognition of diverse nucleic acid activators and collateral substrates. ReChb shares 53% sequence identity with the closest Cas12a ortholog but no longer requires a T-rich PAM and can achieve genome editing in human cells at sites inaccessible to the natural FnCas12a or the engineered and PAM-flexible enAsCas12a. Furthermore, ReChb can be triggered not only by double-stranded DNA but also by single-stranded RNA and DNA targets, leading to non-specific collateral cleavage of all three nucleic acid substrates with similar efficiencies. Finally, tertiary and quaternary structures of ReChb obtained by cryogenic electron microscopy reveal the molecular details underlying its expanded biophysical activities. Overall, ReChb expands the application space of Cas12a nucleases and underscores the potential of ASR for enhancing CRISPR technologies.",

    "abstract": "Small cysteine-rich antifungal peptides with multi-site modes of action (MoA) have potential for development as biofungicides. In particular, legumes of the inverted repeat-lacking clade express a large family of nodule-specific cysteine-rich (NCR) peptides that orchestrate differentiation of nitrogen-fixing bacteria into bacteroids. These NCRs can form two or three intramolecular disulfide bonds and a subset of these peptides with high cationicity exhibits antifungal activity. However, the importance of intramolecular disulfide pairing and MoA against fungal pathogens for most of these plant peptides remains to be elucidated. Our study focused on a highly cationic chickpea NCR13, which has a net charge of +8 and contains six cysteines capable of forming three disulfide bonds. NCR13 expression in Pichia pastoris resulted in formation of two peptide folding variants, NCR13_PFV1 and NCR13_PFV2, that differed in the pairing of two out of three disulfide bonds despite having an identical amino acid sequence. The NMR structure of each PFV revealed a unique three-dimensional fold with the PFV1 structure being more compact but less dynamic. Surprisingly, PFV1 and PFV2 differed profoundly in the potency of antifungal activity against several fungal plant pathogens and their multi-faceted MoA. PFV1 showed significantly faster fungal cell-permeabilizing and cell entry capabilities as well as greater stability once inside the fungal cells. Additionally, PFV1 was more effective in binding fungal ribosomal RNA and inhibiting protein translation in vitro. Furthermore, when sprayed on pepper and tomato plants, PFV1 was more effective in reducing disease symptoms caused by Botrytis cinerea, causal agent of gray mold disease in fruits, vegetables, and flowers. In conclusion, our work highlights the significant impact of disulfide pairing on the antifungal activity and MoA of NCR13 and provides a structural framework for design of novel, potent antifungal peptides for agricultural use.",

Dectin-2 stimulates macrophages in response to pathogen binding while BDCA-2 modulates cytokine production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The oligomeric states of these receptors and the orientations of their CRDs have been investigated by analysis of a naturally occurring disulfide-bonded variant of BDCA-2 and by replacement of transmembrane domains with N-terminal dimerization domains to create extracellular domain dimers of both dectin-2 and BDCA-2. Analysis of these constructs, as well as previously described crystal structures of the CRDs from these proteins and a novel structure of an extended version of the extracellular domain of dectin-2, showed that there is only limited interaction of the CRDs in the dimers, but interactions can be stabilized by the presence of the neck region. The resulting orientation of sugar-binding sites in the dimers would favor crosslinking of multiple dimers by oligosaccharide ligands, causing clustering of FcR\u03b3 to initiate signaling.",

    "abstract": "Nickel-chelatase CfbA, unlike descendant chelatases, is an ancestral class II chelatase with a symmetric active site architecture. CfbA utilizes sirohydrochlorin (SHC) as a physiological substrate in the biosynthesis of coenzyme F430. CbiX<sup>S</sup>, a structural analog of CfbA, can use uroporphyrin III (UPIII) and uroporphyrin I (UPI) as non-physiological substrates. Owing to the broad tetrapyrrole specificity of the unique active site of ancestral class II chelatases, the substrate recognition mechanism of CfbA has garnered interest. Herein, we conducted an X-ray crystallographic analysis of CfbA in complex with UPIII and UPI. Interestingly, the binding sites for UPIII and UPI were distinct. UPI was bound at the entrance of the active site, whereas UPIII was bound deep inside the active site cavity in a manner similar to SHC. Despite the difference in the binding positions of UPIII and UPI, Ser11 at the active site provided critical polar interactions for recognizing UPIII and UPI. Several CfbA variants with a Ser11 mutation were studied to confirm the significance of Ser11's position in the context of tetrapyrrole recognition. The CfbA S11T variant showed Ni<sup>2+</sup>-chelatase activity against coproporphyrin I (CPI), which is a more hydrophobic tetrapyrrole than UPIII and UPI. Using a CPI-docked model of the S11T variant, we proposed that balancing the hydrophobic/polar interactions at residue 11 could alter substrate selectivity. The structural and mutational analyses reported here highlight the importance of polar and hydrophobic interactions at the entry region of the active site for substrate tetrapyrrole recognition by ancestral and descendant class II chelatases.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzymes play a central role in ubiquitin transfer. Disruptions to the ubiquitin system are implicated in multiple diseases, and as a result, molecules that modulate the activity of the ubiquitin system are of interest. E2 enzyme function relies on interactions with partner proteins, and the disruption of these is an effective way to modulate activity. Here, we report the discovery of ubiquitin variants (UbVs) that inhibit the E2 enzyme, Ube2d2 (UbcH5b). The six UbVs identified inhibit ubiquitin chain building, and the structural and biophysical characterisation of two of these demonstrate they bind to Ube2d2 with low micromolar affinity and high specificity. Both characterised UbVs bind at a site that overlaps with E1 binding, while the more inhibitory UbV has an additional binding site that blocks a critical non-covalent ubiquitin-binding site on the E2 enzyme. The discovery of novel protein-based ubiquitin derivatives that inhibit protein-protein interactions is an important step towards discovering small molecules that inhibit the activity of E2 enzymes. Furthermore, the specificity of the UbVs within the Ube2d family suggests that it may be possible to develop tools to selectively inhibit highly related E2 enzymes.",

Here, we present a structural characterization of \u03b1-carboxysome shells generated from recombinant systems, which contain all shell proteins and the scaffolding protein CsoS2. Atomic-resolution cryo-electron microscopy of the shell assemblies, with a maximal size of 54 nm, unveil diverse assembly interfaces between shell proteins, detailed interactions of CsoS2 with shell proteins to drive shell assembly, and the formation of heterohexamers and heteropentamers by different shell protein paralogs, facilitating the assembly of larger empty shells. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the construction principles of \u03b1-carboxysome shells and the role of CsoS2 in governing \u03b1-carboxysome assembly and functionality.",

    "abstract": "c-di-GMP is an important second messenger in bacteria regulating, for example motility, biofilm formation, cell wall biosynthesis, infectivity, and natural transformability. It binds to a multitude of intracellular receptors. This includes proteins containing general secretory pathway II (GSPII) domains such as the N-terminal domain of the Vibrio cholerae ATPase MshE (MshEN) which binds c-di-GMP with two copies of a 24-amino acids sequence motif. The traffic ATPase PilF from Thermus thermophilus is important for type IV pilus biogenesis, twitching motility, surface attachment, and natural DNA-uptake and contains three consecutive homologous GPSII domains. We show that only two of these domains bind c-di-GMP and define the structural basis for the exceptional high affinity of the GSPII-B domain for c-di-GMP, which is 83-fold higher than that of the prototypical MshEN domain. Our work establishes an extended consensus sequence for the c-di-GMP-binding motif and highlights the role of hydrophobic residues for high-affinity recognition of c-di-GMP. Our structure is the first example for a c-di-GMP-binding domain not relying on arginine residues for ligand recognition. We also show that c-di-GMP-binding induces local unwinding of an \u03b1-helical turn as well as subdomain reorientation to reinforce intermolecular contacts between c-di-GMP and the C-terminal subdomain. Abolishing c-di-GMP binding to GSPII-B reduces twitching motility and surface attachment but not natural DNA-uptake. Overall, our work contributes to a better characterization of c-di-GMP binding in this class of effector domains, allows the prediction of high-affinity c-di-GMP-binding family members, and advances our understanding of the importance of c-di-GMP binding for T4P-related functions.",

    "abstract": "The stereoselectivity of enzymes plays a central role in asymmetric biocatalytic reactions, but there remains a dearth of evolution-driven biochemistry studies investigating the evolutionary trajectory of this vital property. Imine reductases (IREDs) are one such enzyme that possesses excellent stereoselectivity, and stereocomplementary members are pervasive in the family. However, the regulatory mechanism behind stereocomplementarity remains cryptic. Herein, we reconstruct a panel of active ancestral IREDs and trace the evolution of stereoselectivity from ancestors to extant IREDs. Combined with coevolution analysis, we reveal six historical mutations capable of recapitulating stereoselectivity evolution. An investigation of the mechanism with X-ray crystallography shows that they collectively reshape the substrate-binding pocket to regulate stereoselectivity inversion. In addition, we construct an empirical fitness landscape and discover that epistasis is prevalent in stereoselectivity evolution. Our findings emphasize the power of ASR in circumventing the time-consuming large-scale mutagenesis library screening for identifying mutations that change functions and support a Darwinian premise from a molecular perspective that the evolution of biological functions is a stepwise process.",

    "abstract": "Phage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases (i.e. lysins) are considered promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics due to their direct peptidoglycan degradation activity and low risk of resistance development. The discovery of these enzymes is often hampered by the limited availability of phage genomes. Herein, we report a new strategy to mine active peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes by lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-primed screening. As a proof-of-concept, five <u>p</u>eptidoglycan <u>h</u>ydrolases from the <i><u>A</u>cinetobacter <u>b</u>aumannii</i> proteome (PHAb7-PHAb11) were identified using PlyF307 lysin-derived peptide as a template. Among them, PHAb10 and PHAb11 showed potent bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens even after treatment at 100\u00b0C for 1 hr, while the other three were thermosensitive. We solved the crystal structures of PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11 and unveiled that hyper-thermostable PHAb10 underwent a unique folding-refolding thermodynamic scheme mediated by a dimer-monomer transition, while thermosensitive PHAb8 formed a monomer. Two mouse models of bacterial infection further demonstrated the safety and efficacy of PHAb10. In conclusion, our antimicrobial peptide-primed strategy provides new clues for the discovery of promising antimicrobial drugs.",

    "abstract": "Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase 2 (MTHFD2), a pivotal mitochondrial enzyme in one-carbon metabolism, is significantly upregulated in various cancers but minimally expressed in normal proliferating cells. In contrast, MTHFD1, which performs similar functions, is predominantly expressed in normal cells. Therefore, targeting MTHFD2 with selective inhibitors holds promise for a broader therapeutic window with reduced toxicity and fewer side effects. This study identified selective 2,4-diamino-6-oxo-1,6-dihydropyrimidin-5-yl ureido-based derivatives through systematic chemical modifications and SAR studies. Structural biology investigations revealed substitutions in the phenyl ring and tail region modulate potency and selectivity toward MTHFD2. Additionally, a comprehensive cell screening platform revealed acute myeloid leukemia cells with FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutations are particularly sensitive to these inhibitors. Furthermore, synergistic effects were observed when combining potential compounds with Alimta. Compound <b>16e</b> emerged as a leading candidate, demonstrating superior inhibition and selectivity for MTHFD2, favorable pharmacokinetics, and potent antitumor efficacy in MOLM-14 xenograft models.",

This study reports structural and biochemical characterizations of Aspergillus oryzae exo-\u03b2-(1,3)-glucanase (AoBgl) belonging to the GH5 family. Purified AoBgl hydrolyses \u03b2-(1,3)-glycosidic linkages of the oligosaccharide laminaritriose and the polysaccharide laminarin effectively. We have determined three high-resolution structures of AoBgl: (a) the apo form at 1.75\u2009\u00c5, (b) the complexed form with bound cellobiose at 1.73\u2009\u00c5 and (c) the glucose-bound form at 1.20\u2009\u00c5. The crystal structures, molecular dynamics simulation studies and site-directed mutagenesis reveal the mode of substrate binding and interactions at the active site. The results also indicate that AoBgl effectively hydrolyses trisaccharides and higher oligosaccharides. The findings from our structural and biochemical studies would aid in rational engineering efforts to generate superior AoBgl variants and similar GH5 enzymes for their industrial use.",

    "abstract": "Inhibition of ubiquitin-specific protease 7, USP7, has been proposed as a mechanism to affect many disease processes, primarily those implicated in oncology. The bound crystal structure of a published high-throughput screening hit with low-micromolar affinity for USP7 identified three regions of the compound for structure-guided optimization. Replacing one side of the compound with different aromatic moieties gave little improvement in affinity, and the central piperidine could not be improved. However, the binding site for the other side of the compound was poorly defined in the crystal structure, which suggested a wide variety of synthetically accessible options for optimization. These were assessed by screening reaction mixtures that introduced different substituents to this other side. Subsequent optimization led to a compound with low-nanomolar affinity for USP7, which showed target engagement in tumors, was tolerated in mice, and showed efficacy in xenograft models.",

All previously characterized IgG-specific ENGases are multi-domain proteins secreted as an immune evasion strategy by Streptococcus pyogenes strains. Here, using in silico analysis and mass spectrometry techniques, we identified a family of single-domain ENGases secreted by pathogenic corynebacterial species that exhibit strict specificity for IgG antibodies. By X-ray crystallographic and surface plasmon resonance analyses, we found that the most catalytically efficient IgG-specific ENGase family member recognizes both protein and glycan components of IgG. Employing in\u00a0vivo models, we demonstrated the remarkable efficacy of this IgG-specific ENGase in mitigating numerous pathologies that rely on Fc\u03b3R-mediated effector functions, including T and B lymphocyte depletion, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue disease, revealing its potential for treating and/or preventing a wide range of IgG-mediated diseases in humans.",

    "abstract": "A highly conserved second-sphere active site \u03b1Ser residue in nitrile hydratase (NHase), that forms a hydrogen bond with the axial metal-bound water molecule, was mutated to Ala, Asp, and Thr, in the Co-type NHase from Pseudonocardia thermophila JCM 3095 (PtNHase) and to Ala and Thr in the Fe-type NHase from Rhodococcus equi TG328-2 (ReNHase). All five mutants were successfully purified; metal analysis via ICP-AES indicated that all three Co-type PtNHase mutants were in their apo-form while the Fe-type \u03b1Ser117Ala and \u03b1Ser117Thr mutants contained 85 and 50\u00a0% of their active site Fe(III) ions, respectively. The k<sub>cat</sub> values obtained for the PtNHase mutant enzymes were between 0.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 and 0.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup> amounting to <0.8\u00a0% of the k<sub>cat</sub> value observed for WT PtNHase. The Fe-type ReNHase mutants retained some detectable activity with k<sub>cat</sub> values of 93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 and 40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup> for the \u03b1Ser117Ala and \u03b1Ser117Thr mutants, respectively, which is \u223c5\u00a0% of WT ReNHase activity towards acrylonitrile. UV-Vis spectra coupled with EPR data obtained on the ReNHase mutant enzymes showed subtle changes in the electronic environment around the active site Fe(III) ions, consistent with altering the hydrogen bonding interaction with the axial water ligand. X-ray crystal structures of the three PtNHase mutant enzymes confirmed the mutation and the lack of active site metal, while also providing insight into the active site hydrogen bonding network. Taken together, these data confirm that the conserved active site \u03b1Ser residue plays an important catalytic role but is not essential for catalysis. They also confirm the necessity of the conserved second-sphere \u03b1Ser residue for the metalation process and subsequent post-translational modification of the \u03b1-subunit in Co-type NHases but not Fe-type NHases, suggesting different mechanisms for the two types of NHases. SYNOPSIS: A strictly conserved active site \u03b1Ser residue in both Co- and Fe-type nitrile hydratases was mutated. This \u03b1Ser residue was found to play an important catalytic function, but is not essential. In Co-type NHases, it appears to be essential for active site maturation, but not in Fe-type NHases.",

    "abstract": "The 1957 H2N2 influenza pandemic virus [A(H2N2)pdm1957] has disappeared from humans since 1968, while H2N2 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are still circulating in birds. It is necessary to reveal the recurrence risk and potential cross-species infection of these AIVs from avian to mammals. We find that H2 AIVs circulating in domestic poultry in China have genetic and antigenic differences compared to the A(H2N2)pdm1957. One H2N2 AIV has a dual receptor-binding property similar to that of the A(H2N2)pdm1957. Molecular and structural studies reveal that the N144S, and N144E or R137M substitutions in hemagglutinin (HA) enable H2N2 avian or human viruses to bind or preferentially bind human-type receptor. The H2N2 AIV rapidly adapts to mice (female) and acquires mammalian-adapted mutations that facilitated transmission in guinea pigs and ferrets (female). These findings on the receptor-binding, infectivity, transmission, and mammalian-adaptation characteristics of H2N2 AIVs provide a reference for early-warning and prevention for this subtype.",

    "abstract": "GH29A \u03b1-l-fucosidases (EC\u00a03.2.1.51) catalyze the release of \u03b1-l-fucosyl moieties from the nonreducing end of glycoconjugates by hydrolysis and some also catalyze transglycosylation. The latter is particularly interesting with regard to designing enzymatic synthesis of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs). We combined the bioinformatics tool conserved unique peptide patterns (CUPP) and phylogenetic clustering to discover new microbial GH29A \u03b1-l-fucosidases of the underexplored CUPP group GH29:13.1. Three uncharacterized bacterial enzymes (EaGH29, SeGH29, and PmGH29) and two previously identified GH29A \u03b1-l-fucosidases (BF3242 and TfFuc1) were selected for reaction optimization, biochemical, and structural characterization. Kinetics, pH-temperature optima, and substrate preference for 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl-\u03b1-l-fucopyranoside (CNP-\u03b1-l-Fuc) and 2'-fucosyllactose (2'FL) were determined. Transglycosylation was favored at high neutral to alkaline pH, especially for EaGH29, SeGH29, TfFuc1, and BF3242, mainly because hydrolysis was decreased. The \u03b1-l-fucosidases exhibited medium regioselectivity in transglycosylation, generally forming two out of five detected lacto-N-fucopentaose (LNFP) isomers from 2'FL and lacto-N-tetraose (LNT). Alkaline pH also affected the transglycosylation product regioselectivity of SeGH29, which was also affected by a Leu/Phe exchange in the acceptor binding site. New crystal structures of TfFuc1 and BF3242 showed congruence in active site topology between these two enzymes and contributed to understanding the function of GH29A \u03b1-l-fucosidases. Notably, the structural data provide new insight into the role of an Asn residue located between the two catalytic residues in the active site.",

    "abstract": "Chymase is a serine-protease produced by mast cells. In the past few decades, its role in fibrotic diseases triggered the search for orally available chymase inhibitors. Aiming at reducing adverse cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction, our research efforts resulted in the discovery of fulacimstat (BAY 1142524). While clinical trials did not demonstrate efficacy in this indication, the recent discovery of a new unexpected biological role of chymase spurred a revival of interest in chymase inhibition: chymase was shown to inactivate plasmin within fibrin-rich clots. Chymase inhibitors are now considered as potential profibrinolytic drugs with low bleeding risk and therefore exceptional safety for the treatment of acute thrombosis settings such as stroke, pulmonary embolism, or venous thrombosis. This article describes the chemical optimization journey from a screening hit to the discovery of fulacimstat (BAY 1142524), a selective chymase inhibitor with a good safety profile, as well as its preclinical <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> characterization.",

The enzymes can adopt an inactive, heme-free (apo) state or an active, heme-containing (holo) state, with the balance between them varying dynamically according to biological conditions. Inhibitors of holo-TDO2 are known but, despite several advantages of the heme-free state as a drug target, no inhibitors of apo-TDO2 have been reported. We describe the discovery of the first apo-TDO2 binding inhibitors, to our knowledge, and their inhibition of cellular TDO2 activity at low nanomolar concentrations. The crystal structure of a potent, small molecule inhibitor bound to apo-TDO2 reveals its detailed binding interactions within the large, hydrophobic heme binding pocket of the active site.",

The natural product GMII inhibitor, swainsonine, blocks processing of cancer-associated <i>N</i>-glycans, but also inhibits the four other human \u03b1-mannosidases, rendering it unsuitable for clinical use. Our previous structure-guided screening of iminosugar pyrrolidine and piperidine fragments identified two micromolar hGMII inhibitors occupying the enzyme active pockets in adjacent, partially overlapping sites. Here we demonstrate that fusing these fragments yields swainsonine-configured indolizidines featuring a C3-substituent that act as selective hGMII inhibitors. Our structure-guided GMII-selective inhibitor design complements a recent combinatorial approach that yielded similarly configured and substituted indolizidine GMII inhibitors, and holds promise for the potential future development of anti-cancer agents targeting Golgi <i>N</i>-glycan processing.",

    "abstract": "Chemical probes have gained importance in the elucidation of signal transduction in biology. Insufficient selectivity and potency, lack of cellular activity and inappropriate use of chemical probes has major consequences on interpretation of biological results. The catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase \u03b1 (PI3K\u03b1) is one of the most frequently mutated genes in cancer, but fast-acting, high-quality probes to define PI3K\u03b1's specific function to clearly separate it from other class I PI3K isoforms, are not available. Here, we present a series of novel covalent PI3K\u03b1-targeting probes with optimized intracellular target access and kinetic parameters. On-target TR-FRET and off-target assays provided relevant kinetic parameters (<i>k</i> <sub>chem</sub>, <i>k</i> <sub>inact</sub> and <i>K</i> <sub>i</sub>) to validate our chemical probes. Additional intracellular nanoBRET tracer displacement measurements showed rapid diffusion across the cell membrane and extremely fast target engagement, while investigations of signaling downstream of PI3K\u03b1 <i>via</i> protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) and forkhead box O (FOXO) revealed blunted pathway activity in cancer cell lines with constitutively activated PI3K\u03b1 lasting for several days. In contrast, persistent PI3K\u03b1 inhibition was rapidly bypassed by other class I PI3K isoforms in cells lacking functional phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). Comparing the rapidly-diffusing, fast target-engaging chemical probe 9 to clinical reversible PI3K\u03b1-selective inhibitors alpelisib, inavolisib and 9r, a reversible analogue of 9, revealed 9's superior potency to inhibit growth (up to 600-fold) associated with sustained suppression of PI3K\u03b1 signaling in breast cancer cell lines. Finally, using a simple washout protocol, the utility of the highly-selective covalent PI3K\u03b1 probe 9 was demonstrated by the quantification of the coupling of insulin, EGF and CXCL12 receptors to distinct PI3K isoforms for signal transduction in response to ligand-dependent activation. Collectively, these findings along with the novel covalent chemical probes against PI3K\u03b1 provide insights into isoform-specific functions in cancer cells and highlight opportunities to achieve improved selectivity and long-lasting efficacy.",

    "abstract": "The concept of targeted protein degradation is at the forefront of modern drug discovery, which aims to eliminate disease-causing proteins using specific molecules. In this paper, we explored the idea to design protein degraders based on the section of ligands that cause protein destabilization, hence that facilitate the cellular breakdown of the target. Our studies present covalent agents targeting Pin1, a cis-trans prolyl isomerase that plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis. Our design strategy entailed iterative optimizations of agents for potency and Pin1 destabilization in vitro. Biophysical and cellular studies suggest that the agents may act like <i>molecular crowbars</i>, displacing protein-stabilizing interactions that open the structure for recognition by the proteasome degradation machinery. This approach resulted in a series of potent and effective Pin1 degraders with potential applications in target validation and in therapeutic development. We propose that our design strategy can identify molecular degraders without engineering bifunctional agents that artificially create interactions between a disease-causing protein and a ubiquitin ligase.",

    "abstract": "The recent success of RFdiffusion, a method for protein structure design with a denoising diffusion probabilistic model, has relied on fine-tuning the RoseTTAFold structure prediction network for protein backbone denoising. Here, we introduce SCUBA-diffusion (SCUBA-D), a protein backbone denoising diffusion probabilistic model freshly trained by considering co-diffusion of sequence representation to enhance model regularization and adversarial losses to minimize data-out-of-distribution errors. While matching the performance of the pretrained RoseTTAFold-based RFdiffusion in generating experimentally realizable protein structures, SCUBA-D readily generates protein structures with not-yet-observed overall folds that are different from those predictable with RoseTTAFold. The accuracy of SCUBA-D was confirmed by the X-ray structures of 16 designed proteins and a protein complex, and by experiments validating designed heme-binding proteins and Ras-binding proteins. Our work shows that deep generative models of images or texts can be fruitfully extended to complex physical objects like protein structures by addressing outstanding issues such as the data-out-of-distribution errors.",

    "abstract": "The functionally conserved subcortical maternal complex (SCMC) is essential for early embryonic development in mammals. Reproductive disorders caused by pathogenic variants in NLRP5, TLE6 and OOEP, three core components of the SCMC, have attracted much attention over the past several years. Evaluating the pathogenicity of a missense variant in the SCMC is limited by the lack of information on its structure, although we recently solved the structure of the mouse SCMC and proposed that reproductive disorders caused by pathogenic variants are related to the destabilization of the SCMC core complex. Here we report the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the human SCMC and uncover that the pyrin domain of NLRP5 is essential for the stability of SCMC. By combining prediction of SCMC stability and in vitro reconstitution, we provide a method for identifying deleterious variants, and we successfully identify a new pathogenic variant of TLE6 (p.A396T). Thus, on the basis of the structure of the human SCMC, we offer a strategy for the diagnosis of reproductive disorders and the discovery of new infertility-associated variants.",

    "abstract": "Adenosine receptors play pivotal roles in physiological processes. Adenosine A<sub>3</sub> receptor (A<sub>3</sub>R), the most recently identified adenosine receptor, is expressed in various tissues, exhibiting important roles in neuron, heart, and immune cells, and is often overexpressed in tumors, highlighting the therapeutic potential of A<sub>3</sub>R-selective agents. Recently, we identified RNA-derived N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) as an endogenous agonist for A<sub>3</sub>R, suggesting the relationship between RNA-derived modified adenosine and A<sub>3</sub>R. Despite extensive studies on the other adenosine receptors, the selectivity mechanism of A<sub>3</sub>R, especially for A<sub>3</sub>R-selective agonists such as m<sup>6</sup>A and namodenoson, remained elusive. Here, we identify tRNA-derived N<sup>6</sup>-isopentenyl adenosine (i<sup>6</sup>A) as an A<sub>3</sub>R-selective ligand via screening of modified nucleosides against the adenosine receptors. Like m<sup>6</sup>A, i<sup>6</sup>A is found in the human body and may be an endogenous A<sub>3</sub>R ligand. Our cryo-EM analyses elucidate the A<sub>3</sub>R-G<sub>i</sub> complexes bound to adenosine, 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA), m<sup>6</sup>A, i<sup>6</sup>A, and namodenoson at overall resolutions of 3.27\u2009\u00c5 (adenosine), 2.86\u2009\u00c5 (NECA), 3.19\u2009\u00c5 (m<sup>6</sup>A), 3.28\u2009\u00c5 (i<sup>6</sup>A), and 3.20\u2009\u00c5 (namodenoson), suggesting the selectivity and activation mechanism of A<sub>3</sub>R. We further conduct structure-guided engineering of m<sup>6</sup>A-insensitive A<sub>3</sub>R, which may aid future research targeting m<sup>6</sup>A and A<sub>3</sub>R, providing a molecular basis for future drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) cleaves the <i>N</i>-terminal amino acids of peptides, which can then bind onto major histocompatibility class I (MHC-I) molecules for presentation onto the cell surface, driving the activation of adaptive immune responses. In cancer, overtrimming of mature antigenic peptides can reduce cytotoxic T-cell responses, and ERAP1 can generate self-antigenic peptides which contribute to autoimmune cellular responses. Therefore, modulation of ERAP1 activity has potential therapeutic indications for cancer immunotherapy and in autoimmune disease. Herein we describe the hit-to-lead optimization of a series of cyclohexyl acid ERAP1 inhibitors, found by X-ray crystallography to bind at an allosteric regulatory site. Structure-based drug design enabled a >1,000-fold increase in ERAP1 enzymatic and cellular activity, resulting in potent and selective tool molecules. For lead compound <b>7</b>, rat pharmacokinetic properties showed moderate unbound clearance and oral bioavailability, thus highlighting the promise of the series for further optimization.",

    "abstract": "Microtubule-dependent endosomal transport is crucial for polar growth, ensuring the precise distribution of cellular cargos such as proteins and mRNAs. However, the molecular mechanism linking mRNAs to the endosomal surface remains poorly understood. Here, we present a structural analysis of the key RNA-binding protein Rrm4 from <i>Ustilago maydis</i>. Our findings reveal a different type of MademoiseLLE domain (MLLE) featuring a seven-helical bundle that provides a distinct binding interface. A comparative analysis with the canonical MademoiseLLE domain of the poly(A)-binding protein Pab1 disclosed unique characteristics of both domains. Deciphering the MLLE binding code enabled prediction and verification of previously unknown Rrm4 interactors containing short linear motifs. Importantly, we demonstrated that the human MLLE domains, such as those of PABPC1 and UBR5, employed a similar principle to distinguish among interaction partners. Thus, our study provides detailed mechanistic insights into how structural variations in the widely distributed MLLE domain facilitate mRNA attachment during endosomal transport.",

    "abstract": "Many enzymes work as homodimers with two distant catalytic sites, but the reason for this choice is often not clear. For the main protease M<sup>pro</sup> of SARS-CoV-2, dimerization is essential for function and plays a regulatory role during the coronaviral replication process. Here, to analyze a possible allosteric mechanism, we use X-ray crystallography, native mass spectrometry, isothermal titration calorimetry, and activity assays to study the interaction of M<sup>pro</sup> with three peptide substrates. Crystal structures show how the plasticity of M<sup>pro</sup> is exploited to face differences in the sequences of the natural substrates. Importantly, unlike in the free form, the M<sup>pro</sup> dimer in complex with these peptides is asymmetric and the structures of the substrates nsp5/6 and nsp14/15 bound to a single subunit show allosteric communications between active sites. We identified arginines 4 and 298 as key elements in the transition from symmetric to asymmetric dimers. Kinetic data allowed the identification of positive cooperativity based on the increase in the processing efficiency (kinetic allostery) and not on the better binding of the substrates (thermodynamic allostery). At the physiological level, this allosteric behavior may be justified by the need to regulate the processing of viral polyproteins in time and space.",

    "abstract": "Uric acid (UA)-responsive transcriptional regulators (UrtRs), which belong to the multiple antibiotic resistance regulator (MarR) superfamily, transcriptionally coordinate virulence and metabolism in bacteria by modulating interactions with operator DNA in response to UA. To elucidate the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of UrtR, we structurally analyzed UrtR proteins, including PecS, MftR, and HucR, alone and in complex with UA or DNA. UrtR contains a dimerization domain (DD) and a winged helix-turn-helix domain (wHTHD) and forms a homodimer primarily via the DD, as observed for other MarR superfamily proteins. However, UrtRs are characterized by a unique N-terminal \u03b1-helix, which contributes to dimerization and UA recognition. In the absence of UA, the UrtR dimer symmetrically binds to the operator double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) by inserting its \u03b14 recognition helix and \u03b2-stranded wing within the wHTHD into the major and minor grooves of dsDNA, respectively. Upon exposure to UA, UrtR accommodates UA in the intersubunit pocket between the DD and wHTHD. UA binding induces a conformational change in the major groove-binding core element of the UrtR wHTHD, generating a DNA binding-incompatible structure. This local allosteric mechanism of UrtR completely differs from that generally observed in other MarR superfamily members, in which the entire wHTHD undergoes effector-responsive global shifts.",

    "abstract": "In consideration of life in extreme environments, the effects of hydrostatic pressure on proteins at the atomic level have drawn substantial interest. Large deviations of temperature and pressure from ambient conditions can shift the free energy landscape of proteins to reveal otherwise lowly populated structural states and even promote unfolding. We report the crystal structure of the heme-containing peroxidase, cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) at 1.5 and 3.0\u00a0kbar and make comparisons to structures determined at 1.0\u00a0bar and cryo-temperatures (100\u00a0K). Pressure produces anisotropic changes in CcP, but compressibility plateaus after 1.5\u00a0kbar. CcP responds to pressure with volume declines at the periphery of the protein where B-factors are relatively high but maintains nearly intransient core structure, hydrogen bonding interactions and active site channels. Changes in active-site solvation and heme ligation reveal pressure sensitivity to protein-ligand interactions and a potential docking site for the substrate peroxide. Compression at the surface affects neither alternate side-chain conformers nor B-factors. Thus, packing in the core, which resembles a crystalline solid, limits motion and protects the active site, whereas looser packing at the surface preserves side-chain dynamics. These data demonstrate that conformational dynamics and packing densities are not fully correlated in proteins and that encapsulation of cofactors by the polypeptide can provide a precisely structured environment resistant to change across a wide range of physical conditions.",

Chemical probes to these enzymes are of interest for their role in cancer and inherited metabolic disease. Here, we report the results of a crystallographic fragment-screening campaign targeting both enzymes. A unique aspect of our approach is the screening of both enzymes simultaneously using crystals of the bifunctional PRODH-GSALDH enzyme, proline utilization A (PutA). A 288-fragment library from Zenobia was screened <i>in crystallo</i> in cocktails of six fragments. Validation X-ray crystallography with individual fragments identified seven crystal hits distributed in the PRODH active site, GSALDH aldehyde substrate-binding site, and GSALDH NAD<sup>+</sup> adenine-binding site. The fragment bound in the PRODH active site, 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol, is structurally distinct from all known PRODH inhibitors as it lacks an anionic anchor and stabilizes open conformations of the active site, motivating the study of eighteen analogs. In total, thirteen crystal structures with resolutions ranging from 1.32 \u00c5 to 1.80 \u00c5 were determined, resolving the poses and interactions of seven fragments from the Zenobia library and five analogs of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol. These results expand the chemical space of probes targeting proline catabolic enzymes and provide new structural information for further inhibitor development.",

    "abstract": "Enteroviruses contain multiple serotypes and can cause severe neurological complications. The intricate life cycle of enteroviruses involving dynamic virus-receptor interaction hampers the development of broad therapeutics and vaccines. Here, using function-based screening, we identify a broadly therapeutic antibody h1A6.2 that potently protects mice in lethal models of infection with both enterovirus A71 and coxsackievirus A16 through multiple mechanisms, including inhibition of the virion-SCARB2 interactions and monocyte/macrophage-dependent Fc effector functions. h1A6.2 mitigates inflammation and improves intramuscular mechanics, which are associated with diminished innate immune signalling and preserved tissue repair. Moreover, cryogenic electron microscopy structures delineate an adaptive binding of h1A6.2 to the flexible and dynamic nature of the VP2 EF loop with a binding angle mimicking the SCARB2 receptor. The coordinated binding mode results in efficient binding of h1A6.2 to all viral particle types and facilitates broad neutralization of enterovirus, therefore informing a promising target for the structure-guided design of pan-enterovirus vaccine.",

    "abstract": "\u00df-Amylase, which catalyses the release of \u00df-anomeric maltose from the non-reducing end of starch, is widely used in the food industry. Increasing its enzyme activity through protein engineering might improve the efficiency of food processing. To obtain detailed structural information to assist rationale design, here the crystal structure of Bacillus cereus \u03b2-amylase (BCB) complexed with maltose was determined by molecular replacement and refined using anisotropic temperature factors to 1.26\u00a0\u00c5 resolution with R<sub>work</sub>/R<sub>free</sub> factors of 12.4/15.7\u00a0%. The structure contains six maltose and one glucose molecules, of which two maltose and one glucose are bound at sites not previously observed in BCB structures. These three new sugar-binding sites are located on the surface and likely to be important in enhancing the degradation of raw-starch granules. In the active site of BCB, two maltose molecules are bound in tandem at subsites -2\u00a0\u223c\u00a0-1 and +1\u00a0\u223c\u00a0+2. Notably, the conformation of the glucose moiety bound at subsite -1 is a mixture of \u03b1-anomeric distorted <sup>1,4</sup>B boat and <sup>4</sup>C<sub>1</sub> chair forms, while those at subsites -2, +1\u00a0\u223c\u00a0+2 are all in the <sup>4</sup>C<sub>1</sub> chair forms. The O1 of the distorted \u03b1-glucose residue at subsite -1 occupies the position of the putative catalytic water, forming a hydrogen bond with OE1 of Glu367 (base catalyst), suggesting that this distorted sugar is not involved in catalysis. Together, these findings pave the way for further improving the functionality of microbial \u00df-amylase enzymes.",

We present the design of CRBN<sup>midi</sup>, a construct that readily expresses from E. coli with high yields as soluble, stable protein without DDB1.

Yet, the structural basis of respiratory complex adaptation upon cold exposure remains elusive. Herein, we combined thermoregulatory physiology and cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to study endogenous respiratory supercomplexes from mice exposed to different temperatures. A cold-induced conformation of CI:III<sub>2</sub> (termed type 2) supercomplex was identified with a \u223c25\u00b0 rotation of CIII<sub>2</sub> around its inter-dimer axis, shortening inter-complex Q exchange space, and exhibiting catalytic states that favor electron transfer. Large-scale supercomplex simulations in mitochondrial membranes reveal how lipid-protein arrangements stabilize type 2 complexes to enhance catalytic activity. Together, our cryo-EM studies, multiscale simulations, and biochemical analyses unveil the thermoregulatory mechanisms and dynamics of increased respiratory capacity in brown fat at the structural and energetic level.",

    "abstract": "The interplay between translation and mRNA decay is widespread in human cells<sup>1-3</sup>. In quality-control pathways, exonucleolytic degradation of mRNA associated with translating ribosomes is mediated largely\u00a0by the cytoplasmic exosome<sup>4-9</sup>, which includes the exoribonuclease complex EXO10 and the helicase complex SKI238 (refs. <sup>10-16</sup>). The helicase can extract mRNA from the ribosome and is expected to transfer it to the exoribonuclease core through a bridging factor, HBS1L3 (also known as SKI7), but the mechanisms of this molecular handover remain unclear<sup>7,17,18</sup>. Here we reveal how human EXO10 is recruited by HBS1L3 (SKI7) to an active ribosome-bound SKI238 complex. We show that rather than a sequential handover, a direct physical coupling mechanism takes place, which culminates in the formation of a cytoplasmic exosome-ribosome supercomplex. Capturing the structure during active decay reveals a continuous path in which an RNA substrate threads from the 80S ribosome through the SKI2 helicase into the exoribonuclease active site of the cytoplasmic exosome complex. The SKI3 subunit of the complex directly binds to HBS1L3 (SKI7) and also engages a surface of the 40S subunit, establishing a recognition platform in collided disomes. Exosome and ribosome thus work together as a single structural and functional unit in co-translational mRNA decay, coordinating their activities in a transient supercomplex.",

    "abstract": "BamA is the central component of the essential \u03b2-barrel assembly machine (BAM), a conserved multi-subunit complex that dynamically inserts and folds \u03b2-barrel proteins into the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Despite recent advances in our mechanistic and structural understanding of BamA, there are few potent and selective tool molecules that can bind to and modulate BamA activity. Here, we explored in vitro selection methods and different BamA/BAM protein formulations to discover peptide macrocycles that kill Escherichia coli by targeting extreme conformational states of BamA. Our studies show that Peptide Targeting BamA-1 (PTB1) targets an extracellular divalent cation-dependent binding site and locks BamA into a closed lateral gate conformation. By contrast, PTB2 targets a luminal binding site and traps BamA into an open lateral gate conformation. Our results will inform future antibiotic discovery efforts targeting BamA and provide a template to prospectively discover modulators of other dynamic integral membrane proteins.",

    "abstract": "Human ABC transporters ABCD1-3 are all localized on the peroxisomal membrane and participate in the \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acyl-CoAs, but they differ from each other in substrate specificity. The transport of branched-chain fatty acids from cytosol to peroxisome is specifically driven by ABCD3, dysfunction of which causes severe liver diseases such as hepatosplenomegaly. Here we report two cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of ABCD3 bound to phytanoyl-CoA and ATP at resolutions of 2.9\u2009\u00c5 and 3.2\u2009\u00c5, respectively. A pair of phytanoyl-CoA molecules were observed in ABCD3, each binding to one transmembrane domain (TMD), which is distinct from our previously reported structure of ABCD1, where each fatty acyl-CoA molecule strongly crosslinks two TMDs. Upon ATP binding, ABCD3 exhibits a conformation that is open towards the peroxisomal matrix, leaving two extra densities corresponding to two CoA molecules deeply embedded in the translocation cavity. Structural analysis combined with substrate-stimulated ATPase activity assays indicated that the present structures might represent two states of ABCD3 in the transport cycle. These findings advance our understanding of fatty acid oxidation and the molecular pathology of related diseases.",

We identified compound <b>8</b>, a 2,4-diaminopyrimidine exhibiting improved pharmacological properties and activity against purified DHFR, and whole cell cultures of two predominant NTM species: <i>Mycobacterium avium</i> and <i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i>. This study underscores the potential of compound <b>8</b> as a promising candidate for the <i>in vivo</i> validation of DHFR as an effective treatment against NTM infections.",

    "abstract": "For mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) a shallow surface-distinct from the substrate binding pocket-called the D(ocking)-groove governs partner protein binding. Screening of broad range of Michael acceptor compounds identified a double-activated, sterically crowded cyclohexenone moiety as a promising scaffold. We show that compounds bearing this structurally complex chiral warhead are able to target the conserved MAPK D-groove cysteine via reversible covalent modification and interfere with the protein-protein interactions of MAPKs. The electronic and steric properties of the Michael acceptor can be tailored via different substitution patterns. The inversion of the chiral center of the warhead can reroute chemical bond formation with the targeted cysteine towards the neighboring, but less nucleophilic histidine. Compounds bind to the shallow MAPK D-groove with low micromolar affinity in vitro and perturb MAPK signaling networks in the cell. This class of chiral, cyclic and enhanced 3D shaped Michael acceptor scaffolds offers an alternative to conventional ATP-competitive drugs modulating MAPK signaling pathways.",

The Arg74Gln mutation shifts substrate preference towards RNA. Purine nucleotide binding differs compared to pyrimidines, confirming the plasticity of the active site. The enzyme-product interactions indicate a gradual, stepwise product release. The activity of SmNuc1 towards c-di-GMP in crystal resulted in a distinguished complex with the emerging product 5'-GMP.

    "abstract": "Green fluorescent protein (GFP) is widely utilized as a fluorescent tag in biochemical fields. Whereas the intermediate (I) state has been proposed in the photoreaction cycle in addition to the A and B states, until now the structure of I has only been estimated by computational studies. In this paper, we report the crystal structures of the I stabilizing variants of GFP at high resolutions where respective atoms can be observed separately. Comparison with the structures in the other states highlights the structural feature of the I state. The side chain of one of the substituted residues, Val203, adopts the gauche- conformation observed for Thr203 in the A state, which is different from the B state. On the other hand, His148 interacts with the chromophore by ordinary hydrogen bonding with a distance of 2.85 \u00c5, while the weaker interaction by longer distances is observed in the A state. Therefore, it was indicated that it is possible to distinguish three states A, B and I by the two hydrogen bond distances O\u03b3-Thr203\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O\u03b7-chromophore and N\u03b41-His148\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O\u03b7-chromophore. We discuss the characteristics of the I intermediate of wild-type GFP on the bases of the structure estimated from the variant structures by quantum chemical calculations.",

Herein, we report the structures of pP1192R in various enzymatic stages using both X-ray crystallography and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. Our data structurally define the pP1192R-modulated DNA topology changes. By presenting the A2+-like metal ion at the pre-cleavage site, the pP1192R-DNA-m-AMSA complex structure provides support for the classical two-metal mechanism in Topo II-mediated DNA cleavage and a better explanation for nucleophile formation. The unique inhibitor selectivity of pP1192R and the difunctional mechanism of pP1192R inhibition by m-AMSA highlight the specificity of viral Topo II in the poison binding site. Altogether, this study provides the information applicable to the development of a pP1192R-targeting anti-ASFV strategy.",

    "abstract": "Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has been widely used to reveal the structures of proteins at atomic resolution. One key challenge is that almost all proteins are predominantly adsorbed to the air-water interface during standard cryo-EM specimen preparation. The interaction of proteins with air-water interface will significantly impede the success of reconstruction and achievable resolution. Here, we highlight the critical role of impenetrable surfactant monolayers in passivating the air-water interface problems, and develop a robust effective method for high-resolution cryo-EM analysis, by using the superstructure GSAMs which comprises surfactant self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) and graphene membrane. The GSAMs works well in enriching the orientations and improving particle utilization ratio of multiple proteins, facilitating the 3.3-\u00c5 resolution reconstruction of a 100-kDa protein complex (ACE2-RBD), which shows strong preferential orientation using traditional specimen preparation protocol. Additionally, we demonstrate that GSAMs enables the successful determinations of small proteins (<100\u2009kDa) at near-atomic resolution. This study expands the understanding of SAMs and provides a key to better control the interaction of protein with air-water interface.",

    "abstract": "The development of electrophilic ligands that rapidly modify specific lysine residues remains a major challenge. Salicylaldehyde-based inhibitors have been reported to form stable imine adducts with the catalytic lysine of protein kinases. However, the targeted lysine in these examples is buried in a hydrophobic environment. A key unanswered question is whether this strategy can be applied to a lysine on the surface of a protein, where rapid hydrolysis of the resulting salicylaldimine is more likely. Here, we describe a series of aminomethyl-substituted salicylaldehydes that target a fully solvated lysine on the surface of the ATPase domain of Hsp90. By systematically varying the orientation of the salicylaldehyde, we discovered ligands with long residence times, the best of which engages Hsp90 in a quasi-irreversible manner. Crystallographic analysis revealed a daisy-chain network of intramolecular hydrogen bonds in which the salicylaldimine is locked into position by the adjacent piperidine linker. This study highlights the potential of aminomethyl salicylaldehydes to generate conformationally stabilized, hydrolysis-resistant imines, even when the targeted lysine is far from the ligand binding site and is exposed to bulk solvent.",

As the only known human Pi exporter to date, XPR1 has an indispensable role in cellular Pi homeostasis<sup>4,5</sup>. Dysfunction of XPR1 is associated with neurodegenerative disease<sup>6-8</sup>. However, the mechanisms underpinning XPR1-mediated Pi efflux and regulation by the intracellular inositol polyphosphate (InsPP) sensor SPX domain remain poorly understood. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of human XPR1 in Pi-bound closed, open and InsP<sub>6</sub>-bound forms, revealing the structural basis for XPR1 gating and regulation by InsPPs. XPR1 consists of an N-terminal SPX domain, a dimer-formation core domain and a Pi transport domain. Within the transport domain, three basic clusters are responsible for Pi binding and transport, and a conserved W573 acts as a molecular switch for gating. In addition, the SPX domain binds to InsP<sub>6</sub> and facilitates Pi efflux by liberating the C-terminal loop that limits Pi entry. This study provides a conceptual framework for the mechanistic understanding of Pi homeostasis by XPR1 homologues in fungi, plants and animals.",

    "abstract": "Necrosis-inducing secreted protein 1 (NIS1) is a core effector of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota fungi. They inhibit the immune responses of host plants mainly through interaction with the multi-functional coreceptor BRI1-associated receptor kinase 1 (BAK1). However, the structural mechanism of the NIS1 family and how they are recognized by BAK1 are unknown. Herein, we report the first crystal structure of the NIS1 family protein, the Magnaporthe oryzae NIS1 (MoNIS1), analyze the recognition mechanism of NIS1s by BAK1, and explore regulation of the NIS1-BAK1 interaction by a chemical compound. MoNIS1 exists as a \u03b2 barrel formed by eight \u03b2 strands, a folding mode that has not been reported. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) assay suggested that \u03b24-\u03b25 loop and \u03b25 strand of MoNIS1 participate in OsBAK1 interaction, which was supported by further single-point mutational assays. For OsBAK1, HDX-MS assay suggested four regions involved in MoNIS1 interaction. Additionally, we identified a compound that blocks MoNIS1-OsBAK1 interaction in vitro and inhibits the virulence of M. oryzae on rice. Collectively, we determined the first structure of NIS1 family effectors, presented the recognition mechanism of NIS1 by BAK1, and showed that blocking NIS1-BAK1 interaction could be a new target for fungicide development.",

    "abstract": "Ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) is required for the growth and virulence of many pathogenic bacteria, including Vibrio cholerae (Vc), the causative agent of the disease cholera. For this bacterium, Feo is the primary system that transports Fe<sup>2+</sup> into the cytosol. FeoB, the main component of this system, is regulated by a soluble cytosolic domain termed NFeoB. Recent reanalysis has shown that NFeoBs can be classified as either GTP-specific or NTP-promiscuous, but the structural and mechanistic bases for these differences were not known. To explore this intriguing property of FeoB, we solved the X-ray crystal structures of VcNFeoB in both the apo and the GDP-bound forms. Surprisingly, this promiscuous NTPase displayed a canonical NFeoB G-protein fold like GTP-specific NFeoBs. Using structural bioinformatics, we hypothesized that residues surrounding the nucleobase could be important for both nucleotide affinity and specificity. We then solved the X-ray crystal structures of N150T VcNFeoB in the apo and GDP-bound forms to reveal H-bonding differences surrounding the guanine nucleobase. Interestingly, isothermal titration calorimetry revealed similar binding thermodynamics of the WT and N150T proteins to guanine nucleotides, while the behavior in the presence of adenine nucleotides was dramatically different. AlphaFold models of VcNFeoB in the presence of ADP and ATP showed important conformational changes that contribute to nucleotide specificity among FeoBs. Combined, these results provide a structural framework for understanding FeoB nucleotide promiscuity, which could be an adaptive measure utilized by pathogens to ensure adequate levels of intracellular iron across multiple metabolic landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Artificial metalloenzymes, in which a metal complex and protein matrix are combined, have been synthesized to catalyze stereoselective reactions using the chiral environment provided by the protein cavity. Artificial metalloenzymes can be engineered by the chemical modification and mutagenesis of the protein matrix. We developed artificial non-heme metalloenzymes using a cupin superfamily protein (TM1459) with a 4-His tetrad-metal-binding motif. The Cu-bound H52A/C106D mutant with 3-His triad showed a S-enantioselective Michael addition of nitromethane to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone, 2-aza-chalcone 1. In this study, we demonstrated a chemical modification near the copper-binding site of this mutant to reverse its enantioselectivity. For chemical modification, the amino acid on the Si-face of the binding state of 1 to the copper center was replaced with Cys, followed by reaction with 4,4'-dithiopyridine (4-PDS) to form S-(pyridin-4-ylthio)cysteine (Cys-4py). Cu-bound I49C-4py/H52A/C106D showed reversal of the enantioselectivity from S-form to R-form (ee\u00a0=\u00a071%, (R)). The effect of steric hindrance of the amino acids at position 49 on enantioselectivity was investigated using I49X/H52A/C106D mutants (X\u00a0=\u00a0A, C, I, F, and W). Additionally, chemical modification with 2,2'-dithiopyridine (2-PDS) produced I49-2py/H52A/C106D, which showed lower R-enantioselectivity than I49-4py/H52A/C106D. Among the mutants, the 4py-modification on the Si-face was the most effective in reversing the enantioselectivity. By tuning the Re-face side, the H54A mutation introduced into the I49C-4py/H52A/C106D increased the R-enantioselectivity (ee\u00a0=\u00a088%, (R)). X-ray crystallography revealed a coordinated structure with ligation of thiopyridine in Cu-bound I49C-4py/H52A/H54A/C106D.",

    "abstract": "Ligand binding hotspots are regions of protein surfaces that form particularly favourable interactions with small molecule pharmacophores. Targeting interactions with these hotspots maximises the efficiency of ligand binding. Existing methods are capable of identifying hotspots but often lack assays to quantify ligand binding and direct elaboration at these sites. Herein, we describe a fragment-based competitive <sup>19</sup>F Ligand Based\u2005NMR (LB-NMR) screening platform that enables routine, quantitative ligand profiling focused at ligand-binding hotspots. As a proof of concept, the method was applied to 4'-phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) from Mycobacterium abscessus (Mabs). X-ray crystallographic characterisation of the hits from a 960-member fragment screen identified three ligand-binding hotspots across the PPAT active site. From the fragment hits a collection of <sup>19</sup>F reporter candidates were designed and synthesised. By rigorous prioritisation and use of optimisation workflows, a single <sup>19</sup>F reporter molecule was generated for each hotspot. Profiling the binding of a set of structurally characterised ligands by competitive <sup>19</sup>F\u2005LB-NMR with this suite of <sup>19</sup>F reporters recapitulated the binding affinity and site ID assignments made by ITC and X-ray crystallography. This quantitative mapping of ligand binding events at hotspot level resolution establishes the utility of the fragment-based competitive <sup>19</sup>F\u2005LB-NMR screening platform for hotspot-directed ligand profiling.",

    "abstract": "Glutamate dehydrogenases (GDHs) are key enzymes at the crossroads of N and C metabolism in plants. Legumes, whose N metabolism is particularly intricate, possess a unique type of GDH. This study presents an analysis of a legume-type GDH (isoform 2) from Medicago truncatula (MtGDH2). We measured MtGDH2 activity in both the Glu\u00a0\u2192\u00a02-oxoglutarate (2OG) and 2OG\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Glu reaction directions and obtained kinetic parameters for Glu, 2OG, NAD<sup>+</sup>, and NADH. Inhibition assays revealed that compounds possessing di- or tricarboxylates act as inhibitors of plant GDHs. Interestingly, 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylate (PYR) weakly inhibits MtGDH2 compared to Arabidopsis thaliana homologs. Furthermore, we explored tetrazole derivatives to discover 3-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)benzoic acid (TBA) as an MtGDH2 inhibitor. The kinetic experiments are supported by six crystal structures, solved as: (i) unliganded enzyme, (ii) trapping the reaction intermediate 2-amino-2-hydroxyglutarate and NAD<sup>+</sup>, and also complexed with NAD<sup>+</sup> and inhibitors such as (iii) citrate, (iv) PYR, (v) isophthalate, and (vi) TBA. The complex with TBA revealed a new mode of action that, in contrast to other inhibitors, prevents domain closure. This discovery points to TBA as a starting point for the development of novel GDH inhibitors to study the functions of GDH in plants and potentially boost biomass production.",

Binding to integrin \u03b1v\u03b28 activates L-TGF-\u03b21/GARP. The dogma is that mature TGF-\u03b2 must physically dissociate from L-TGF-\u03b21 for signaling to occur. Our previous studies discovered that \u03b1v\u03b28-mediated TGF-\u03b2 autocrine signaling can occur without TGF-\u03b21 release from its latent form. Here, we show that mice engineered to express TGF-\u03b21 that cannot release from L-TGF-\u03b21 survive without early lethal tissue inflammation, unlike those with TGF-\u03b21 deficiency. Combining cryogenic electron microscopy with cell-based assays, we reveal a dynamic allosteric mechanism of autocrine TGF-\u03b21 signaling without release where \u03b1v\u03b28 binding redistributes the intrinsic flexibility of L-TGF-\u03b21 to expose TGF-\u03b21 to its receptors. Dynamic allostery explains the TGF-\u03b23 latency/activation mechanism and why TGF-\u03b23 functions distinctly from TGF-\u03b21, suggesting that it broadly applies to other flexible cell surface receptor/ligand systems.",

    "abstract": "We report bio-structural, bio-chemical and bio-physical evidence demonstrating how small molecules can bind to both wild-type and mutant IDH1, but only inhibit the enzymatic activity of the mutant isoform. Enabled through x-ray crystallography, we characterized a series of small molecule inhibitors that bound to mutant IDH1 differently than the marketed inhibitor Ivosidenib, for which we have determined the x-ray crystal structure. Across the industry several mutant IDH1 inhibitor chemotypes bind to this allosteric IDH1 pocket and selectively inhibit the mutant enzyme. Detailed characterization by a variety of biophysical techniques and NMR studies led us to propose how compounds binding in the allosteric IDH1 R132H pocket inhibit the production of 2-Hydroxy glutarate.",

    "abstract": "Peptide-based frameworks aim to integrate protein architecture into solid-state materials using simpler building blocks. Despite the growing number of peptide frameworks, there are few strategies to rationally engineer essential properties like pore size and shape. Designing peptide assemblies is generally hindered by the difficulty of predicting complex networks of weak intermolecular interactions. Peptides conjugated to polyaromatic groups are a unique case where assembly appears to be strongly driven by \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, suggesting that rationally adjusting the geometry of the \u03c0-stackers could create novel structures. Here, we report peptide elongation as a simple mechanism to predictably tune the angle between the \u03c0-stacking groups to produce a remarkable diversity of pore shapes and sizes, including some that are mesoporous. Notably, rapid jumps in pore size and shape can occur with just a single amino acid insertion. The geometry of the \u03c0-stacking residues also significantly influences framework structure, representing an additional dimension for tuning. Lastly, sequence identity can also indirectly modulate the \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions. By correlating each of these factors with detailed crystallographic data, we find that, despite the complexity of peptide structure, the shape and polarity of the tectons are straightforward predictors of framework structure. These guidelines are expected to accelerate the development of advanced porous materials with protein-like capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) cellulose is a naturally occurring modified cellulose produced by several Enterobacteriaceae. The minimal components of the E. coli cellulose synthase complex include the catalytically active BcsA enzyme, a hexameric semicircle of the periplasmic BcsB protein, and the outer membrane (OM)-integrated BcsC subunit containing periplasmic tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR). Additional subunits include BcsG, a membrane-anchored periplasmic pEtN transferase associated with BcsA, and BcsZ, a periplasmic cellulase of unknown biological function. While cellulose synthesis and translocation by BcsA are well described, little is known about its pEtN modification and translocation across the cell envelope. We show that the N-terminal cytosolic domain of BcsA positions three BcsG copies near the nascent cellulose polymer. Further, the semicircle's terminal BcsB subunit tethers the N-terminus of a single BcsC protein in a trans-envelope secretion system. BcsC's TPR motifs bind a putative cello-oligosaccharide near the entrance to its OM pore. Additionally, we show that only the hydrolytic activity of BcsZ but not the subunit itself is necessary for cellulose secretion, suggesting a secretion mechanism based on enzymatic removal of translocation incompetent cellulose. Lastly, protein engineering introduces cellulose pEtN modification in orthogonal cellulose biosynthetic systems. These findings advance our understanding of pEtN cellulose modification and secretion.",

Polyamines are essential for cell growth and proliferation; consequently, inhibition of polyamine deacetylation represents a possible strategy for cancer chemotherapy. In this work, we have designed six acetylated phenylthioketone inhibitors of HDAC10 containing positively charged <i>para</i>- and <i>meta</i>-substituted amino groups designed to target interactions with E274, the gatekeeper that recognizes the positively charged ammonium group of the substrate <i>N</i> <sup>8</sup>-acetylspermidine. We prepared each of these inhibitors through a short synthetic route of six steps. By adapting a low-cost colorimetric activity assay, we measured low-micromolar IC<sub>50</sub> values for these compounds against a humanized construct of zebrafish HDAC10 (A24E-D94A HDAC10). Selected inhibitors were cocrystallized with A24E-D94A zebrafish HDAC10 and zebrafish HDAC6 to provide insight into class IIb isozyme affinity and selectivity.",

    "abstract": "Biological membranes are partitioned into functional zones termed membrane microdomains, which contain specific lipids and proteins<sup>1-3</sup>. The composition and organization of membrane microdomains remain controversial because few techniques are available that allow the visualization of lipids in situ without disrupting their native behaviour<sup>3,4</sup>. The yeast eisosome, composed of the BAR-domain proteins Pil1 and Lsp1 (hereafter, Pil1/Lsp1), scaffolds a membrane compartment that senses and responds to mechanical stress by flattening and releasing sequestered factors<sup>5-9</sup>. Here we isolated near-native eisosomes as helical tubules made up of a lattice of Pil1/Lsp1 bound to plasma membrane lipids, and solved their structures by helical reconstruction. Our structures reveal a striking organization of membrane lipids, and, using in vitro reconstitutions and molecular dynamics simulations, we confirmed the positioning of individual PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, phosphatidylserine and sterol molecules sequestered beneath the Pil1/Lsp1 coat. Three-dimensional variability analysis of the native-source eisosomes revealed a dynamic stretching of the Pil1/Lsp1 lattice that affects the sequestration of these lipids. Collectively, our results support a mechanism in which stretching of the Pil1/Lsp1 lattice liberates lipids that would otherwise be anchored by the Pil1/Lsp1 coat, and thus provide mechanistic insight into how eisosome BAR-domain proteins create a mechanosensitive membrane microdomain.",

Its reuptake from the synaptic cleft heavily relies on the noradrenaline transporter (NET) located in the presynaptic membrane<sup>2</sup>. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the human NET in both its apo state and when bound to substrates or antidepressant drugs, with resolutions ranging from 2.5\u2009\u00c5 to 3.5\u2009\u00c5. The two substrates, noradrenaline and dopamine, display a similar binding mode within the central substrate binding site (S1) and within a newly identified extracellular allosteric site (S2). Four distinct antidepressants, namely, atomoxetine, desipramine, bupropion and escitalopram, occupy the S1 site to obstruct substrate transport in distinct conformations. Moreover, a potassium ion was observed within sodium-binding site 1 in the structure of the NET bound to desipramine under the KCl condition. Complemented by structural-guided biochemical analyses, our studies reveal the mechanism of substrate recognition, the alternating access of NET, and elucidate the mode of action of the four antidepressants.",

    "abstract": "Copper nitrite reductases (CuNiRs) exhibit a strong pH dependence of their catalytic activity. Structural movies can be obtained by serially recording multiple structures (frames) from the same spot of a crystal using the MSOX serial crystallography approach. This method has been combined with on-line single crystal optical spectroscopy to capture the pH-dependent structural changes that accompany during turnover of CuNiRs from two Rhizobia species. The structural movies, initiated by the redox activation of a type-1 copper site (T1Cu) via X-ray generated photoelectrons, have been obtained for the substrate-free and substrate-bound states at low (high enzymatic activity) and high (low enzymatic activity) pH. At low pH, formation of the product nitric oxide (NO) is complete at the catalytic type-2 copper site (T2Cu) after a dose of 3 MGy (frame 5) with full bleaching of the T1Cu ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) 455\u00a0nm band (S(\u03c3)<sub>Cys</sub>\u00a0\u2192\u00a0T1Cu<sup>2+</sup>) which in itself indicates the electronic route of proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) from T1Cu to T2Cu. In contrast at high pH, the changes in optical spectra are relatively small and the formation of NO is only observed in later frames (frame 15 in Br<sup>2D</sup>NiR, 10 MGy), consistent with the loss of PCET required for catalysis. This is accompanied by decarboxylation of the catalytic Asp<sub>CAT</sub> residue, with CO<sub>2</sub> trapped in the catalytic pocket.",

Autophagy-related proteins (ATGs) 2A and 9A have an essential role in autophagy by mediating lipid transfer and re-equilibration between membranes for autophagosome formation. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of human ATG2A in complex with WD-repeat protein interacting with phosphoinositides 4 (WIPI4) at 3.2\u2009\u00c5 and the ATG2A-WIPI4-ATG9A complex at 7\u2009\u00c5 global resolution. On the basis of molecular dynamics simulations, we propose a mechanism of lipid extraction from the donor membranes. Our analysis revealed 3:1 stoichiometry of the ATG9A-ATG2A complex, directly aligning the ATG9A lateral pore with ATG2A lipid transfer cavity, and an interaction of the ATG9A trimer with both the N-terminal and the C-terminal tip of rod-shaped ATG2A. Cryo-electron tomography of ATG2A liposome-binding states showed that ATG2A tethers lipid vesicles at different orientations. In summary, this study provides a molecular basis for the growth of the phagophore membrane and lends structural insights into spatially coupled lipid transport and re-equilibration during autophagosome formation.",

    "abstract": "RHOA mutations are found at diverse residues in various cancer types, implying mutation- and cell-specific mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Here, we focus on the underlying mechanisms of two gain-of-function RHOA mutations, A161P and A161V, identified in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. We find that RHOA<sup>A161P</sup> and RHOA<sup>A161V</sup> are both fast-cycling mutants with increased guanine nucleotide dissociation/association rates compared with RHOA<sup>WT</sup> and show reduced GTP-hydrolysis activity. Crystal structures reveal an altered nucleotide association in RHOA<sup>A161P</sup> and an open nucleotide pocket in RHOA<sup>A161V</sup>. Both mutations perturb the dynamic properties of RHOA switch regions and shift the conformational landscape important for RHOA activity, as shown by <sup>31</sup>P NMR and molecular dynamics simulations. Interestingly, RHOA<sup>A161P</sup> and RHOA<sup>A161V</sup> can interact with effectors in the GDP-bound state. <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC NMR spectra support the existence of an active population in RHOA<sup>A161V</sup>-GDP. The distinct interaction mechanisms resulting from the mutations likely favor an RHOA<sup>WT</sup>-like \"ON\" conformation, endowing GDP-bound state effector binding activity.",

    "abstract": "Casein kinase-2 (CK2) are serine/threonine kinases with dual co-factor (ATP and GTP) specificity, that are involved in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular functions. Small molecules targeting CK2 have been described in the literature targeting different binding pockets of the kinase with a focus on type I inhibitors such as the recently published chemical probe SGC-CK2-1. In this study, we investigated whether known allosteric inhibitors binding to a pocket adjacent to helix \u03b1D could be combined with ATP mimetic moieties defining a novel class of ATP competitive compounds with a unique binding mode. Linking both binding sites requires a chemical linking moiety that would introduce a 90-degree angle between the ATP mimetic ring system and the \u03b1D targeting moiety, which was realized using a sulfonamide. The synthesized inhibitors were highly selective for CK2 with binding constants in the nM range and low micromolar activity. While these inhibitors need to be further improved, the present work provides a structure-based design strategy for highly selective CK2 inhibitors.",

Here, we crystallized a proteolytically truncated surface entropy reduction variant of HcLAAO4 and solved its structure in substrate-free form and in complex with diverse substrates. The ability to support the aliphatic portion of a substrate's side chain by an overall hydrophobic active site is responsible for the broad substrate spectrum of HcLAAO4, including l-amino acids with big aromatic, acidic and basic side chains. Based on the structural findings, we generated an E288H variant with increased activity toward pharmaceutical building blocks of high interest.",

    "abstract": "Metal-ion-dependent nucleases play crucial roles in cellular defense and biotechnological applications. Time-resolved crystallography has resolved catalytic details of metal-ion-dependent DNA hydrolysis and synthesis, uncovering the essential roles of multiple metal ions during catalysis. The histidine-metal (His-Me) superfamily nucleases are renowned for binding one divalent metal ion and requiring a conserved histidine to promote catalysis. Many His-Me family nucleases, including homing endonucleases and Cas9 nuclease, have been adapted for biotechnological and biomedical applications. However, it remains unclear how the single metal ion in His-Me nucleases, together with the histidine, promotes water deprotonation, nucleophilic attack, and phosphodiester bond breakage. By observing DNA hydrolysis <i>in crystallo</i> with His-Me I-PpoI nuclease as a model system, we proved that only one divalent metal ion is required during its catalysis. Moreover, we uncovered several possible deprotonation pathways for the nucleophilic water. Interestingly, binding of the single metal ion and water deprotonation are concerted during catalysis. Our results reveal catalytic details of His-Me nucleases, which is distinct from multi-metal-ion-dependent DNA polymerases and nucleases.",

For the Ub pathway, E1 enzymes catalyse transthiolation from an E1~Ub thioester to an E2~Ub thioester. Transthiolation is also required for transfer of Ub from an E2~Ub thioester to HECT (homologous to E6AP C terminus) and RBR (ring-between-ring) E3 ligases to form E3~Ub thioesters<sup>4-6</sup>. How isoenergetic transfer of thioester bonds is driven forward by enzymes in the Ub pathway remains unclear. Here we isolate mimics of transient transthiolation intermediates for E1-Ub(T)-E2 and E2-Ub(T)-E3<sup>HECT</sup> complexes (where\u00a0T denotes Ub in a thioester or Ub undergoing transthiolation) using a chemical strategy with native enzymes and near-native Ub to capture and visualize a continuum of structures determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. These structures and accompanying biochemical experiments illuminate conformational changes in Ub, E1, E2 and E3 that are coordinated with the chemical reactions to facilitate directional transfer of Ub from each enzyme to the next.",

    "abstract": "AMPA glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are ion channel tetramers that mediate the majority of fast excitatory synaptic transmission. They are composed of four subunits (GluA1-GluA4); the GluA2 subunit dominates AMPAR function throughout the forebrain. Its extracellular N-terminal domain (NTD) determines receptor localization at the synapse, ensuring reliable synaptic transmission and plasticity. This synaptic anchoring function requires a compact NTD tier, stabilized by a GluA2-specific NTD interface. Here we show that low pH conditions, which accompany synaptic activity, rupture this interface. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations reveal that protonation of an interfacial histidine residue (H208) centrally contributes to NTD rearrangement. Moreover, in stark contrast to their canonical compact arrangement at neutral pH, GluA2 cryo-electron microscopy structures exhibit a wide spectrum of NTD conformations under acidic conditions. We show that the consequences of this pH-dependent conformational control are twofold: rupture of the NTD tier slows recovery from desensitized states and increases receptor mobility at mouse hippocampal synapses. Therefore, a proton-triggered NTD switch will shape both AMPAR location and kinetics, thereby impacting synaptic signal transmission.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial interactions are vital for adapting to changing environments, with quorum sensing (QS) systems playing a central role in coordinating behaviors through small signaling molecules. The RRNPPA family is the prevalent QS systems in Bacillota and mediating communication through secreted oligopeptides, which are processed into active pheromones by extracellular proteases. Notably, in several cases the propeptides show the presence of multiple putative pheromones within their sequences, which has been proposed as a mechanism to diversify peptide-receptor specificity and potentially facilitate new functions. However, neither the processes governing the maturation of propeptides containing multiple pheromones, nor their functional significance has been evaluated. Here, using 2 Rap systems from bacteriophages infecting Bacillus subtilis that exhibit different types of pheromone duplication in their propeptides, we investigate the maturation process and the molecular and functional activities of the produced pheromones. Our results reveal that distinct maturation processes generate multiple mature pheromones, which bind to receptors with varying affinities but produce identical structural and biological responses. These findings add additional layers in the complexity of QS communication and regulation, opening new possibilities for microbial social behaviors, highlighting the intricate nature of bacterial interactions and adaptation.",

XBB lineage members were noted for their improved immune evasion and transmissibility. Here, we determine cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, EG.5, and EG.5.1 spike (S)\u00a0ectodomains to reveal reinforced 3-receptor binding domain (RBD)-down receptor-inaccessible closed states mediated by interprotomer RBD interactions previously observed in BA.1 and BA.2. Improved XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16 RBD stability compensated for stability loss caused by early Omicron mutations, while the F456L substitution reduced EG.5 RBD stability. S1 subunit mutations had long-range impacts on conformation and epitope presentation in the S2 subunit. Our results reveal continued S protein evolution via simultaneous optimization of multiple parameters, including stability, receptor binding, and immune evasion, and the dramatic effects of relatively few residue substitutions in altering the S protein conformational landscape.",

    "abstract": "Tigecycline is widely used for treating complicated bacterial infections for which there are no effective drugs. It inhibits bacterial protein translation by blocking the ribosomal A-site. However, even though it is also cytotoxic for human cells, the molecular mechanism of its inhibition remains unclear. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of tigecycline-bound human mitochondrial 55S, 39S, cytoplasmic 80S and yeast cytoplasmic 80S ribosomes. We find that at clinically relevant concentrations, tigecycline effectively targets human 55S mitoribosomes, potentially, by hindering A-site tRNA accommodation and by blocking the peptidyl transfer center. In contrast, tigecycline does not bind to human 80S ribosomes under physiological concentrations. However, at high tigecycline concentrations, in addition to blocking the A-site, both human and yeast 80S ribosomes bind tigecycline at another conserved binding site restricting the movement of the L1 stalk. In conclusion, the observed distinct binding properties of tigecycline may guide new pathways for drug design and therapy.",

    "abstract": "Histones are essential for genome compaction and transcription regulation in eukaryotes, where they assemble into octamers to form the nucleosome core. In contrast, archaeal histones assemble into dimers that form hypernucleosomes upon DNA binding. Although histone homologs have been identified in bacteria recently, their DNA-binding characteristics remain largely unexplored. Our study reveals that the bacterial histone HBb (Bd0055) is indispensable for the survival of Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, suggesting critical roles in DNA organization and gene regulation. By determining crystal structures of free and DNA-bound HBb, we unveil its distinctive dimeric assembly, diverging from those of eukaryotic and archaeal histones, while also elucidating how it binds and bends DNA through interaction interfaces reminiscent of eukaryotic and archaeal histones. Building on this, by employing various biophysical and biochemical approaches, we further substantiated the ability of HBb to bind and compact DNA by bending in a sequence-independent manner. Finally, using DNA affinity purification and sequencing, we reveal that HBb binds along the entire genomic DNA of B. bacteriovorus without sequence specificity. These distinct DNA-binding properties of bacterial histones, showcasing remarkable similarities yet significant differences from their archaeal and eukaryotic counterparts, highlight the diverse roles histones play in DNA organization across all domains of life.",

    "abstract": "Glutamate transmission and activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors are the fundamental means by which neurons control their excitability and neuroplasticity<sup>1</sup>. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is unique among all ligand-gated channels, requiring two ligands-glutamate and glycine-for activation. These receptors function as heterotetrameric ion channels, with the channel opening dependent on the simultaneous binding of glycine and glutamate to the extracellular ligand-binding domains (LBDs) of the GluN1 and GluN2 subunits, respectively<sup>2,3</sup>. The exact molecular mechanism for channel gating by the two ligands has been unclear, particularly without structures representing the open channel and apo states. Here we show that the channel gate opening requires tension in the linker connecting the LBD and transmembrane domain (TMD) and rotation of the extracellular domain relative to the TMD. Using electron cryomicroscopy, we captured the structure of the\u00a0GluN1-GluN2B\u00a0(GluN1-2B) NMDAR in its open state bound to a positive allosteric modulator. This process rotates and bends the pore-forming helices in GluN1 and GluN2B, altering the symmetry of the TMD channel from pseudofourfold to twofold. Structures of GluN1-2B NMDAR in apo and single-liganded states showed that binding of either glycine or glutamate alone leads to distinct GluN1-2B dimer arrangements but insufficient tension in the LBD-TMD linker for channel opening. This mechanistic framework identifies a key determinant for channel gating and a potential pharmacological strategy for modulating NMDAR activity.",

    "abstract": "Development of optimal therapeutics for disease states that can be associated with increased membrane cholesterol requires better molecular understanding of lipid modulation of the drug target. Type 1 cholecystokinin receptor (CCK1R) agonist actions are affected by increased membrane cholesterol, enhancing ligand binding and reducing calcium signaling, while agonist actions of the closely related CCK2R are not. In this work, we identified a set of chimeric human CCK1R/CCK2R mutations that exchange the cholesterol sensitivity of these 2 receptors, providing powerful tools when expressed in CHO and HEK-293 model cell lines to explore mechanisms. Static, low energy, high-resolution structures of the mutant CCK1R constructs, stabilized in complex with G protein, were not substantially different, suggesting that alterations to receptor dynamics were key to altered function. We reveal that cholesterol-dependent dynamic changes in the conformation of the helical bundle of CCK receptors affects both ligand binding at the extracellular surface and G protein coupling at the cytosolic surface, as well as their interrelationships involved in stimulus-response coupling. This provides an ideal setting for potential allosteric modulators to correct the negative impact of membrane cholesterol on CCK1R.",

These mogrosides are glucosylated to different degrees, with mogroside V (M5) and siamenoside I (SIA) being two mogrosides with high intensities of sweetness. SgUGT94-289-3 constitutes a uridine diphosphate (UDP)-dependent glycosyltransferase (UGT) responsible for the biosynthesis of M5 and SIA, by continuously catalyzing glucosylation on mogroside IIe (M2E) and on the subsequent intermediate mogroside products. However, the mechanism of its promiscuous substrate recognition and multiple catalytic modes remains unclear. Here, we report multiple complex structures and the enzymatic characterization of the glycosyltransferase SgUGT94-289-3. We show that SgUGT94-289-3 adopts a dual-pocket organization in its active site, which allows the two structurally distinct reactive ends of mogrosides to be presented from different pockets to the active site for glucosylation reaction, thus enabling both substrate promiscuity and catalytic regioselectivity. We further identified a structural motif that is essential to catalytic activity and regioselectivity, and generated SgUGT94-289-3 mutants with greatly improved M5/SIA production from M2E in an in vitro one-pot setup.",

Here, we combine monoclonal antibody (mAb) isolation with deep B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire sequencing of rhesus macaques immunized with prefusion-stabilized spike glycoprotein. Longitudinal tracing of spike-sorted B cell lineages in multiple immune compartments demonstrates increasing somatic hypermutation and broad dissemination of vaccine-elicited B cells in draining and non-draining lymphoid compartments, including the bone marrow, spleen and, most notably, periaortic lymph nodes. Phylogenetic analysis of spike-specific monoclonal antibody lineages identified through deep repertoire sequencing delineates extensive intra-clonal diversification that shaped neutralizing activity. Structural analysis of the spike in complex with a broadly neutralizing mAb provides a molecular basis for the observed differences in neutralization breadth between clonally related antibodies. Our findings highlight that immunization leads to extensive intra-clonal B cell evolution where members of the same lineage can both retain the original epitope specificity and evolve to recognize additional spike variants not previously encountered.",

    "abstract": "Methaqualone, a quinazolinone marketed commercially as Quaalude, is a central nervous system depressant that was used clinically as a sedative-hypnotic, then became a notorious recreational drug in the 1960s-80s. Due to its high abuse potential, medical use of methaqualone was eventually prohibited, yet it persists as a globally abused substance. Methaqualone principally targets GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, which are the major inhibitory neurotransmitter-gated ion channels in the brain. The restricted status and limited accessibility of methaqualone have contributed to its pharmacology being understudied. Here, we use cryo-EM to localize the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor binding sites of methaqualone and its more potent derivative, PPTQ, to the same intersubunit transmembrane sites targeted by the general anesthetics propofol and etomidate. Both methaqualone and PPTQ insert more deeply into subunit interfaces than the previously-characterized modulators. Binding of quinazolinones to this site results in widening of the extracellular half of the ion-conducting pore, following a trend among positive allosteric modulators in destabilizing the hydrophobic activation gate in the pore as a mechanism for receptor potentiation. These insights shed light on the underexplored pharmacology of quinazolinones and further elucidate the molecular mechanisms of allosteric GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulation through transmembrane binding sites.",

    "abstract": "Cells depend on their endolysosomal system for nutrient uptake and downregulation of plasma membrane proteins. These processes rely on endosomal maturation, which requires multiple membrane fusion steps. Early endosome fusion is promoted by the Rab5 GTPase and its effector, the hexameric CORVET tethering complex, which is homologous to the lysosomal HOPS. How these related complexes recognize their specific target membranes remains entirely elusive. Here, we solve the structure of CORVET by cryo-electron microscopy and revealed its minimal requirements for membrane tethering. As expected, the core of CORVET and HOPS resembles each other. However, the function-defining subunits show marked structural differences. Notably, we discover that unlike HOPS, CORVET depends not only on Rab5 but also on phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) and membrane lipid packing defects for tethering, implying that an organelle-specific membrane code enables fusion. Our data suggest that both shape and membrane interactions of CORVET and HOPS are conserved in metazoans, thus providing a paradigm how tethering complexes function.",

We combined precise biochemical definition of complex I catalysis with high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures in the phospholipid bilayer of coupled vesicles to reveal the mechanism of the transition into the dormant state, modulated by membrane interactions.

In contrast, the inhibition of the constitutive proteasome subunit \u03b25c correlates with cytotoxicity against non-immune cells. Therefore, LMP7/LMP2 dual inhibitors with high selectivity over \u03b25c may be desirable for treating autoimmune diseases. In this study, we present the optimization and discovery of \u03b1-amido boronic acids using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The exploitation of structural differences between the proteasome subunits led to the identification of a highly selective LMP7/LMP2 dual inhibitor 19. Molecular dynamics simulation based on cryo-EM structures of the proteasome subunits complexed with 19 explained the inhibitory activity profile. In mice immunized with 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl conjugated to ovalbumin, results indicate that 19 is orally bioavailable and shows promise as potential treatment for autoimmune diseases.",

    "abstract": "G-quadruplexes (G4s) formed by guanine-rich nucleic acids induce genome instability through impeding DNA replication fork progression. G4s are stable DNA structures, the unfolding of which require the functions of DNA helicases. Pif1 helicase binds preferentially to G4 DNA and plays multiple roles in maintaining genome stability, but the mechanism by which Pif1 unfolds G4s is poorly understood. Here we report the co-crystal structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1 (ScPif1) bound to a G4 DNA with a 5' single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) segment. Unlike the Thermus oshimai Pif1-G4 structure, in which the 1B and 2B domains confer G4 recognition, ScPif1 recognizes G4 mainly through the wedge region in the 1A domain that contacts the 5' most G-tetrad directly. A conserved Arg residue in the wedge is required for Okazaki fragment processing but not for mitochondrial function or for suppression of gross chromosomal rearrangements. Multiple substitutions at this position have similar effects on resolution of DNA duplexes and G4s, suggesting that ScPif1 may use the same wedge to unwind G4 and dsDNA. Our results reveal the mechanism governing dsDNA unwinding and G4 unfolding by ScPif1 helicase that can potentially be generalized to other eukaryotic Pif1 helicases and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Numerous molecular machines are required to drive the central dogma of molecular biology. However, the means by which these numerous proteins emerged in the early evolutionary stage of life remains enigmatic. Many of them possess small \u03b2-barrel folds with different topologies, represented by double-psi \u03b2-barrels (DPBBs) conserved in DNA and RNA polymerases, and similar but topologically distinct six-stranded \u03b2-barrel RIFT or five-stranded \u03b2-barrel folds such as OB and SH3 in ribosomal proteins. Here, we discover that the previously reconstructed ancient DPBB sequence could also adopt a \u03b2-barrel fold named Double-Zeta \u03b2-barrel (DZBB), as a metamorphic protein. The DZBB fold is not found in any modern protein, although its structure shares similarities with RIFT and OB. Indeed, DZBB could be transformed into them through simple engineering experiments. Furthermore, the OB designs could be further converted into SH3 by circular-permutation as previously predicted. These results indicate that these \u03b2-barrels diversified quickly from a common ancestor at the beginning of the central dogma evolution.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophage \u03a6KZ (PhiKZ) is the founding member of a family of giant bacterial viruses. It has potential as a therapeutic as its host, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, kills tens of thousands of people worldwide each year. \u03a6KZ infection is independent of the host transcriptional apparatus; the virus forms a \"nucleus\", producing a proteinaceous barrier around the \u03a6KZ genome that excludes the host immune systems. It expresses its own non-canonical multi-subunit non-virion RNA polymerase (nvRNAP), which is imported into its \"nucleus\" to transcribe viral genes. The \u03a6KZ nvRNAP is formed by four polypeptides representing homologues of the eubacterial \u03b2/\u03b2' subunits, and a fifth that is likely to have evolved from an ancestral homologue to \u03c3-factor. We have resolved the structure of the \u03a6KZ nvRNAP initiating transcription from its cognate promoter, p119L, including previously disordered regions. Our results shed light on the similarities and differences between \u03a6KZ nvRNAP mechanisms of transcription and those of canonical eubacterial RNAPs and the related non-canonical nvRNAP of bacteriophage AR9.",

    "abstract": "The function of proteins depends on their correct structure and proper dynamics. Understanding the dynamics of target proteins facilitates drug design and development. However, dynamic information is often hidden in the spatial structure of proteins. It is important but difficult to identify the specific residues that play a decisive role in protein dynamics. Here, we report that a critical glycine residue (Gly463) dominates the motion of threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) and the sensitivity of the enzyme to antibiotics. Obafluorin (OB), a natural antibiotic, is a novel covalent inhibitor of ThrRS. The binding of OB induces a large conformational change in ThrRS. Through five crystal structures, biochemical and biophysical analyses, and computational simulations, we found that Gly463 plays an important role in the dynamics of ThrRS. Mutating this flexible residue into more rigid residues did not damage the enzyme's three-dimensional structure but significantly improved the thermal stability of the enzyme and suppressed its ability to change conformation. These mutations cause resistance of ThrRS to antibiotics that are conformationally selective, such as OB and borrelidin. This work not only elucidates the molecular mechanism of the self-resistance of OB-producing Pseudomonas fluorescens but also emphasizes the importance of backbone kinetics for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-targeting drug development.",

    "abstract": "The Mycobacterium tuberculosis trifunctional enzyme (MtTFE) is an \u03b1<sub>2</sub>\u03b2<sub>2</sub> tetrameric enzyme in which the \u03b1-chain harbors the 2E-enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECH) and 3S-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HAD) active sites, and the \u03b2-chain provides the 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (KAT) active site. Linear, medium-chain and long-chain 2E-enoyl-CoA molecules are the preferred substrates of MtTFE. Previous crystallographic binding and modeling studies identified binding sites for the acyl-CoA substrates at the three active sites, as well as the NAD binding pocket at the HAD active site. These studies also identified three additional CoA binding sites on the surface of MtTFE that are different from the active sites. It has been proposed that one of these additional sites could be of functional relevance for the substrate channeling (by surface crawling) of reaction intermediates between the three active sites. Here, 226 fragments were screened in a crystallographic fragment-binding study of MtTFE crystals, resulting in the structures of 16 MtTFE-fragment complexes. Analysis of the 121 fragment-binding events shows that the ECH active site is the `binding hotspot' for the tested fragments, with 41 binding events. The mode of binding of the fragments bound at the active sites provides additional insight into how the long-chain acyl moiety of the substrates can be accommodated at their proposed binding pockets. In addition, the 20 fragment-binding events between the active sites identify potential transient binding sites of reaction intermediates relevant to the possible channeling of substrates between these active sites. These results provide a basis for further studies to understand the functional relevance of the\u00a0latter binding sites and to identify substrates for which channeling is crucial.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic vesicles are organelles with a precisely defined protein and lipid composition<sup>1,2</sup>, yet the molecular mechanisms for the biogenesis of synaptic vesicles are mainly unknown. Here we discovered a well-defined interface between the synaptic vesicle V-ATPase and synaptophysin by in situ cryo-electron tomography and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy of functional synaptic vesicles isolated from mouse brains<sup>3</sup>. The synaptic vesicle V-ATPase is an ATP-dependent proton pump that establishes the proton gradient across the synaptic vesicle, which in turn drives the uptake of neurotransmitters<sup>4,5</sup>. Synaptophysin<sup>6</sup> and its paralogues synaptoporin<sup>7</sup> and synaptogyrin<sup>8</sup> belong to a family of abundant synaptic vesicle proteins whose function is still unclear. We performed structural and functional studies of synaptophysin-knockout mice, confirming the identity of synaptophysin as an interaction partner with the V-ATPase. Although there is little change in the conformation of the V-ATPase upon interaction with synaptophysin, the presence of synaptophysin in synaptic vesicles profoundly affects the copy number of V-ATPases. This effect on the topography of synaptic vesicles suggests that synaptophysin assists in their biogenesis. In support of this model, we observed that synaptophysin-knockout mice exhibit severe seizure susceptibility, suggesting an imbalance of neurotransmitter release as a physiological consequence of the absence of synaptophysin.",

    "abstract": "DNA aptamers have emerged as novel molecular tools in disease theranostics owing to their high binding affinity and specificity for protein targets, which rely on their ability to fold into distinctive three-dimensional (3D) structures. However, delicate atomic interactions that shape the 3D structures are often ignored when designing and modeling aptamers, leading to inefficient functional optimization. Challenges persist in determining high-resolution aptamer-protein complex structures. Moreover, the experimentally determined 3D structures of DNA molecules with exquisite functions remain scarce. These factors impede our comprehension and optimization of some important DNA aptamers. Here, we performed a streamlined solution NMR-based structural investigation on the 41-nt sgc8c, a prominent DNA aptamer used to target membrane protein tyrosine kinase 7, for cancer theranostics. We show that sgc8c prefolds into an intricate three-way junction (3WJ) structure stabilized by long-range tertiary interactions and extensive base-base stackings. Delineated by NMR chemical shift perturbations, site-directed mutagenesis, and 3D structural information, we identified essential nucleotides constituting the key functional elements of sgc8c that are centralized at the core of 3WJ. Leveraging the well-established structure-function relationship, we efficiently engineered two sgc8c variants by modifying the apical loop and introducing <sub><i>L</i></sub>-DNA base pairs to simultaneously enhance thermostability, biostability, and binding affinity for both protein and cell targets, a feat not previously attained despite extensive efforts. This work showcases a simplified NMR-based approach to comprehend and optimize sgc8c without acquiring the complex structure, and offers principles for the sophisticated structure-function organization of DNA molecules.",

    "abstract": "The middle (MID) domain of eukaryotic Argonaute (Ago) proteins and archaeal and bacterial homologues mediates the interaction with the 5'-terminal nucleotide of miRNA and siRNA guide strands. The MID domain of human Ago2 (hAgo2) is comprised of 139 amino acids with a molecular weight of 15.56 kDa. MID adopts a Rossman-like beta1-alpha1-beta2-alpha2-beta3-alpha3-beta4-alpha4 fold with a nucleotide specificity loop between beta3 and alpha3. Multiple crystal structures of nucleotides bound to hAgo2 MID have been reported, whereby complexes were obtained by soaking ligands into crystals of MID domain alone. This protocol describes a simplified one-step approach to grow well-diffracting crystals of hAgo2 MID-nucleotide complexes by mixing purified His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO-MID fusion protein, Ulp1 protease, and excess nucleotide in the presence of buffer and precipitant. The crystal structures of MID complexes with UMP, UTP and 2'-3' linked \u03b1-L-threofuranosyl thymidine-3'-triphosphate (tTTP) are presented.

    "abstract": "The principal effect controlling the oxygen affinity of vertebrate haemoglobins (Hbs) is the allosteric switch between R and T forms with relatively high and low oxygen affinity respectively. Uniquely among jawed vertebrates, crocodilians possess Hb that shows a profound drop in oxygen affinity in the presence of bicarbonate ions. This allows them to stay underwater for extended periods by consuming almost all the oxygen present in the blood-stream, as metabolism releases carbon dioxide, whose conversion to bicarbonate and hydrogen ions is catalysed by carbonic anhydrase. Despite the apparent universal utility of bicarbonate as an allosteric regulator of Hb, this property evolved only in crocodilians. We report here the molecular structures of both human and a\u00a0crocodilian Hb in the deoxy and liganded states, solved by cryo-electron microscopy. We\u00a0reveal the precise interactions between two bicarbonate ions and the crocodilian protein at symmetry-related sites found only in the T state. No other known effector of vertebrate Hbs binds anywhere near these sites.",

However, no clinically approved drugs for these proteins exist, as their systemic inhibition can induce deleterious side effects. To address this problem, we developed a modular antibody-based platform for targeted drug delivery by conjugating non-natural peptide inhibitors (NNPIs) to antibodies. NNPIs were functionalized with reactive warheads for covalent inhibition, optimized with deep saturation mutagenesis and conjugated to antibodies to enable cell-type-specific delivery. Our antibody-peptide inhibitor conjugates specifically blocked the activity of cathepsins in different cancer cells, as well as osteoclasts, and showed therapeutic efficacy in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our approach allows for the rapid design of selective cathepsin inhibitors and can be generalized to inhibit a broad class of proteases in cancer and other diseases.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial gene expression relies on mitoribosomes to translate mitochondrial mRNAs. The biogenesis of mitoribosomes is an intricate process involving multiple assembly factors. Among these factors, GTP-binding proteins (GTPBPs) play important roles. In bacterial systems, numerous GTPBPs are required for ribosome subunit maturation, with EngB being a GTPBP involved in the ribosomal large subunit assembly. In this study, we focus on exploring the function of GTPBP8, the human homolog of EngB. We find that ablation of GTPBP8 leads to the inhibition of mitochondrial translation, resulting in significant impairment of oxidative phosphorylation. Structural analysis of mitoribosomes from GTPBP8 knock-out cells shows the accumulation of mitoribosomal large subunit assembly intermediates that are incapable of forming functional monosomes. Furthermore, fPAR-CLIP analysis reveals that GTPBP8 is an RNA-binding protein that interacts specifically with the mitochondrial ribosome large subunit 16\u2009S rRNA. Our study highlights the role of GTPBP8 as a component of the mitochondrial gene expression machinery involved in mitochondrial large subunit maturation.",

    "abstract": "l-(+)-Tartaric acid plays important roles in various industries, including pharmaceuticals, foods, and chemicals. <i>cis</i>-Epoxysuccinate hydrolases (CESHs) are crucial for converting <i>cis</i>-epoxysuccinate to l-(+)-tartrate in the industrial production process. There is, however, a lack of detailed structural and mechanistic information on CESHs, limiting the discovery and engineering of these industrially relevant enzymes. In this study, we report the crystal structures of <i>Ro</i>CESH and <i>Ko</i>CESH-l-(+)-tartrate complex. These structures reveal the key amino acids of the active pocket and the catalytic triad residues and elucidate a dynamic catalytic process involving conformational changes of the active site. Leveraging the structural insights, we identified a robust <i>Bm</i>CESH (550 \u00b1 20 U\u00b7mg<sup>-1</sup>) with sustained catalytic activity even at a 3 M substrate concentration. After six batches of transformation, immobilized cells with overexpressed <i>Bm</i>CESH maintained 69% of their initial activity, affording an overall productivity of 200 g/L/h. These results provide valuable insights into the development of high-efficiency CESHs and the optimization of biotransformation processes for industrial uses.",

    "abstract": "It has been shown previously that a set of three modifications-termed S1, Crystal Kappa, and elbow-act synergistically to improve the crystallizability of an antigen-binding fragment (Fab) framework. Here, we prepared a phage-displayed library and performed crystallization screenings to identify additional substitutions-located near the heavy-chain elbow region-which cooperate with the S1, Crystal Kappa, and elbow modifications to increase expression and improve crystallizability of the Fab framework even further. One substitution (K141Q) supports the signature Crystal Kappa-mediated Fab:Fab crystal lattice packing interaction. Another substitution (E172G) improves the compatibility of the elbow modification with the Fab framework by alleviating some of the strain incurred by the shortened and bulkier elbow linker region. A third substitution (F170W) generates a split-Fab conformation, resulting in a powerful crystal lattice packing interaction comprising the biological interaction interface between the variable heavy and light chain domains. In sum, we have used K141Q, E172G, and F170W substitutions-which complement the S1, Crystal Kappa, and elbow modifications-to generate a set of highly crystallizable Fab frameworks that can be used as chaperones to enable facile elucidation of Fab:antigen complex structures by x-ray crystallography.",

    "abstract": "Recent findings in cell biology have rekindled interest in Z-DNA, the left-handed helical form of DNA. We report here that two minimally modified nucleosides, 2'F-araC and 2'F-riboG, induce the formation of the Z-form under low ionic strength. We show that oligomers entirely made of these two nucleosides exclusively produce left-handed duplexes that bind to the Z\u03b1 domain of ADAR1. The effect of the two nucleotides is so dramatic that Z-form duplexes are the only species observed in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer and neutral pH, and no B-form is observed at any temperature. Hence, in contrast to other studies reporting formation of Z/B-form equilibria by a preference for purine glycosidic angles in syn, our NMR and computational work revealed that sequential 2'F\u2026H2N and intramolecular 3'H\u2026N3' interactions stabilize the left-handed helix. The equilibrium\u00a0between B- and Z- forms is slow in the 19F NMR time scale (\u2265ms), and each conformation exhibited unprecedented chemical shift differences in the 19F signals. This observation led to a reliable estimation of the relative population of B and Z species and enabled us to monitor B-Z transitions under different conditions. The unique features of 2'F-modified DNA should thus be a valuable addition to existing techniques for specific detection of new Z-binding proteins and ligands.",

The intricacies of Pol\u03b3 regulation and its interactions with regulatory proteins, which are essential for fine-tuning polymerase function, remain poorly understood. Misregulation of the Pol\u03b3 heterotrimer, consisting of (i) PolG, the polymerase catalytic subunit\u00a0and (ii) PolG2, the accessory subunit, ultimately results in mitochondrial diseases. Here, we used single particle cryo-electron microscopy to resolve the structure of PolG in its apoprotein state and we captured Pol\u03b3\u00a0at three intermediates within the catalytic cycle: DNA bound, engaged, and an active polymerization state. Chemical crosslinking mass spectrometry, and site-directed mutagenesis uncovered the region of LonP1 engagement of PolG, which promoted proteolysis and regulation of PolG protein levels. PolG2 clinical variants, which disrupted a stable Pol\u03b3 complex, led to enhanced LonP1-mediated PolG degradation. Overall, this insight into Pol\u03b3 aids in an understanding of mitochondrial DNA replication and characterizes how machinery of the replication fork may be targeted for proteolytic degradation when improperly functioning.",

    "abstract": "The exosome multiprotein complex plays a critical role in RNA processing and degradation. This system governs the regulation of mRNA quality, degradation in the cytoplasm, the processing of short noncoding RNA, and the breakdown of RNA fragments. We determined two crystal structures of exosome components from <i>Thermoplasma acidophilum</i> (<i>Taci</i>): one with a resolution of 2.3 \u00c5 that reveals the central components (<i>Taci</i>Rrp41 and <i>Taci</i>Rrp42), and another with a resolution of 3.5 \u00c5 that displays the whole exosome (<i>Taci</i>Rrp41, <i>Taci</i>Rrp42, and <i>Taci</i>Rrp4). The fundamental exosome structure revealed the presence of a heterodimeric complex consisting of <i>Taci</i>Rrp41 and <i>Taci</i>Rrp42. The structure comprises nine subunits, with <i>Taci</i>Rrp41 and <i>Taci</i>Rrp42 arranged in a circular configuration, while <i>Taci</i>Rrp4 is located at the apex. The RNA degradation capabilities of the <i>Taci</i>Rrp4:41:42 complex were verified by RNA degradation assays, consistent with prior findings in other archaeal exosomes. The resemblance between archaeal exosomes and bacterial PNPase suggests a common mechanism for RNA degradation. Despite sharing comparable topologies, the surface charge distributions of <i>Taci</i>Rrp4 and other archaea structures are surprisingly distinct. Different RNA breakdown substrates may be responsible for this variation. These newfound structural findings enhance our comprehension of RNA processing and degradation in biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Tumor-suppressor let-7 pre-microRNAs (miRNAs) are regulated by terminal uridylyltransferases TUT7 and TUT4 that either promote let-7 maturation by adding a single uridine nucleotide to the pre-miRNA 3' end or mark them for degradation by the addition of multiple uridines. Oligo-uridylation is increased in cells by enhanced TUT7/4 expression and especially by the RNA-binding pluripotency factor LIN28A. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, we captured high-resolution structures of active forms of TUT7 alone, of TUT7 plus pre-miRNA and of both TUT7 and TUT4 bound with pre-miRNA and LIN28A. Our structures reveal that pre-miRNAs engage the enzymes in fundamentally different ways depending on the presence of LIN28A, which clamps them onto the TUTs to enable processive 3' oligo-uridylation. This study reveals the molecular basis for mono- versus oligo-uridylation by TUT7/4, as determined by the presence of LIN28A, and thus their mechanism of action in the regulation of cell fate and in cancer.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the metal-substituted catalytic activity of human cysteamine dioxygenase (ADO), an enzyme pivotal in regulating thiol metabolism and contributing to oxygen homeostasis. Our findings demonstrate the catalytic competence of cobalt(II)- and nickel(II)-substituted ADO in cysteamine oxygenation. Notably, Co(II)-ADO exhibited superiority over Ni(II)-ADO despite remaining significantly less active than the natural enzyme. Structural analyses through X-ray crystallography and cobalt K-edge excitation confirmed successful metal substitution with minimal structural perturbations. This provided a robust structural basis, supporting a conserved catalytic mechanism tailored to distinct metal centers. This finding challenges the proposed high-valent ferryl-based mechanism for thiol dioxygenases, suggesting a non-high-valent catalytic pathway in the native enzyme. Further investigation of the cysteamine-bound or a peptide mimic of <i>N</i>-terminus RGS5 bound Co(II)-ADO binary complex revealed the metal center's high-spin (<i>S</i> = 3/2) state. Upon reaction with O<sub>2</sub>, a kinetically and spectroscopically detectable intermediate emerged with a ground spin state of <i>S</i> = 1/2. This intermediate exhibits a characteristic <sup>59</sup>Co hyperfine splitting (<i>A</i> = 67 MHz) structure in the EPR spectrum alongside UV-vis features, consistent with known low-spin Co(III)-superoxo complexes. This observation, unique for protein-bound thiolate-ligated cobalt centers in a protein, unveils the capacities for O<sub>2</sub> activation in such metal environments. These findings provide valuable insights into the non-heme iron-dependent thiol dioxygenase mechanistic landscape, furthering our understanding of thiol metabolism regulation. The exploration of metal-substituted ADO sheds light on the intricate interplay between metal and catalytic activity in this essential enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Infectious diseases are a significant cause of death, and recent studies estimate that common bacterial infectious diseases were responsible for 13.6% of all global deaths in 2019. Among the most significant bacterial pathogens is Staphylococcus aureus, accounting for more than 1.1 million deaths worldwide in 2019. Vitamin biosynthesis has been proposed as a promising target for antibacterial therapy. Here, we investigated the biochemical, structural, and dynamic properties of the enzyme complex responsible for vitamin B6 (pyridoxal 5-phosphate, PLP) biosynthesis in S.\u00a0aureus, which comprises enzymes SaPdx1 and SaPdx2. The crystal structure of the 24-mer complex of SaPdx1-SaPdx2 enzymes indicated that the S.\u00a0aureus PLP synthase complex forms a highly dynamic assembly with transient interaction between the enzymes. Solution scattering data indicated that SaPdx2 typically binds to SaPdx1 at a substoichiometric ratio. We propose a structure-based view of the PLP synthesis mechanism initiated with the assembly of SaPLP synthase complex that proceeds in a highly dynamic interaction between Pdx1 and Pdx2. This interface interaction can be further explored as a potentially druggable site for the design of new antibiotics.",

However, as grown, biomolecular crystals are fragile in solutions other than their growth conditions. For crystals to achieve their full potential as hosts for other molecules, crystals can be made stronger with bioconjugation. Building on our previous work using carbodiimide 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)carbodiimide (EDC) for chemical ligation, here, we investigate DNA junction architecture through sticky base overhang lengths and the role of scaffold proteins in cross-linking within two classes of biomolecular crystals: cocrystals of DNA-binding proteins and pure DNA crystals. Both crystal classes contain DNA junctions where DNA strands stack up end-to-end. Ligation yields were studied as a function of sticky base overhang length and terminal phosphorylation status. The best ligation performance for both crystal classes was achieved with longer sticky overhangs and terminal 3'phosphates. Notably, EDC chemical ligation was achieved in crystals with pore sizes too small for intracrystal transport of ligase enzyme. Postassembly cross-linking produced dramatic stability improvements for both DNA crystals and cocrystals in water and blood serum. The results presented may help crystals containing DNA achieve broader application utility, including as structural biology scaffolds.",

It is highly susceptible to photodamage under high-light conditions and the damaged PSII needs to be restored through a process known as the PSII repair cycle. The detailed molecular mechanism underlying the PSII repair process remains mostly elusive. Here, we report biochemical and structural features of a PSII-repair intermediate complex, likely arrested at an early stage of the PSII repair process in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The complex contains three protein factors associated with a damaged PSII core, namely Thylakoid Enriched Factor 14 (TEF14), Photosystem II Repair Factor 1 (PRF1), and Photosystem II Repair Factor 2 (PRF2). TEF14, PRF1 and PRF2 may facilitate the release of the manganese-stabilizing protein PsbO, disassembly of peripheral light-harvesting complexes from PSII and blockage of the Q<sub>B</sub> site, respectively. Moreover, an \u03b1-tocopherol quinone molecule is located adjacent to the heme group of cytochrome b<sub>559</sub>, potentially fulfilling a photoprotective role by preventing the generation of reactive oxygen species.",

    "abstract": "Several interleukin-1 (IL-1) family members, including IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, require processing by inflammasome-associated caspases to unleash their activities. Here, we unveil, by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), two major conformations of the complex between caspase-1 and pro-IL-18. One conformation is similar to the complex of caspase-4 and pro-IL-18, with interactions at both the active site and an exosite (closed conformation), and the other only contains interactions at the active site (open conformation). Thus, pro-IL-18 recruitment and processing by caspase-1 is less dependent on the exosite than the active site, unlike caspase-4. Structure determination by nuclear magnetic resonance uncovers a compact fold of apo pro-IL-18, which is similar to caspase-1-bound pro-IL-18 but distinct from cleaved IL-18. Binding sites for IL-18 receptor and IL-18 binding protein are only formed upon conformational changes after pro-IL-18 cleavage. These studies show how pro-IL-18 is selected as a caspase-1 substrate, and why cleavage is necessary for its inflammatory activity.",

    "abstract": "Despite tremendous progress in precision oncology, adaptive resistance mechanisms limit the long-term effectiveness of molecularly targeted agents. Here we evaluated the pharmacological profile of MTX-531 that was computationally designed to selectively target two key resistance drivers, epidermal growth factor receptor and phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K). MTX-531 exhibits low-nanomolar potency against both targets with a high degree of specificity predicted by cocrystal structural analyses. MTX-531 monotherapy uniformly resulted in tumor regressions of squamous head and neck patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. The combination of MTX-531 with mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase or KRAS-G12C inhibitors led to durable regressions of BRAF-mutant or KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer PDX models, resulting in striking increases in median survival. MTX-531 is exceptionally well tolerated in mice and uniquely does not lead to the hyperglycemia commonly seen with PI3K inhibitors. Here, we show that MTX-531 acts as a weak agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3, an attribute that likely mitigates hyperglycemia induced by PI3K inhibition. This unique feature of MTX-531 confers a favorable therapeutic index not typically seen with PI3K inhibitors.",

Pseudouridine (\u03a8), the most abundant modification on rRNA, changes during the parasite life cycle. Alterations in the level of a specific \u03a8 in helix 69 (H69) affected ribosome function. To decipher the molecular mechanism of this phenotype, we determine the structure of ribosomes lacking the single \u03a8 and its parental strain at \u223c2.4-3\u00a0\u00c5 resolution using cryo-EM. Our findings demonstrate the significance of a single \u03a8 on H69 to its structure and the importance for its interactions with helix 44 and specific tRNAs. Our study suggests that rRNA modification affects translation of mRNAs carrying codon bias due to selective accommodation of tRNAs by the ribosome. Based on the high-resolution structures, we propose a mechanism explaining how the ribosome selects specific tRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Single particle analysis from cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is particularly attractive for complexes for which structure prediction remains intractable, such as antibody-antigen complexes. Here we obtain the detailed structure of a particularly difficult complex between human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and the antigen-binding fragments from two distinct therapeutic antibodies binding to distant parts of the flexible HER2, pertuzumab and trastuzumab (HTP). We highlight the strengths and limitations of current data processing software in dealing with various kinds of heterogeneities, particularly continuous conformational heterogeneity, and in describing the motions that can be extracted from our dataset. Our HTP structure provides a more detailed view than the one previously available for this ternary complex. This allowed us to pinpoint a previously overlooked loop in domain IV that may be involved both in binding of trastuzumab and in HER2 dimerization. This finding may contribute to explain the synergistic anticancer effect of the two antibodies. We further propose that the flexibility of the HTP complex, beyond the difficulties it causes for cryo-EM analysis, actually reflects regulation of HER2 signaling and its inhibition by therapeutic antibodies. Notably we obtain our best data with ultra-thin continuous carbon grids, showing that with current cameras their use to alleviate particle misdistribution is compatible with a protein complex of only 162\u00a0kDa. Perhaps most importantly, we provide here a dataset for such a smallish protein complex for further development of software accounting for continuous conformational heterogeneity in cryo-EM images.",

Here, we describe the multi-omic chemical validation of <i>Plasmodium</i> M1 alanyl metalloaminopeptidase as an attractive drug target using the selective inhibitor, MIPS2673. MIPS2673 demonstrated potent inhibition of recombinant <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (<i>Pf</i>A-M1) and <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> (<i>Pv</i>A-M1) M1 metalloaminopeptidases, with selectivity over other <i>Plasmodium</i> and human aminopeptidases, and displayed excellent in vitro antimalarial activity with no significant host cytotoxicity. Orthogonal label-free chemoproteomic methods based on thermal stability and limited proteolysis of whole parasite lysates revealed that MIPS2673 solely targets <i>Pf</i>A-M1 in parasites, with limited proteolysis also enabling estimation of the binding site on <i>Pf</i>A-M1 to within ~5 \u00c5 of that determined by X-ray crystallography. Finally, functional investigation by untargeted metabolomics demonstrated that MIPS2673 inhibits the key role of <i>Pf</i>A-M1 in haemoglobin digestion. Combined, our unbiased multi-omic target deconvolution methods confirmed the on-target activity of MIPS2673, and validated selective inhibition of M1 alanyl metalloaminopeptidase as a promising antimalarial strategy.",

    "abstract": "Metallo-\u03b2-lactamases (MBL) deactivate \u03b2-lactam antibiotics through a catalytic reaction caused by two zinc ions at the active center. Since MBLs deteriorate a wide range of antibiotics, they are dangerous factors for bacterial multidrug resistance. In this work, organic synthesis, computational design, and crystal structure analysis were performed to obtain potent MBL inhibitors based on a previously identified hit compound. The hit compound comprised 3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinone linked with a phenyl-ether-methyl group via a thiazole ring. In the first step, the thiazole ring was replaced with a tertiary amine to avoid the planar structure. In the second step, we virtually modified the compound by keeping the quinolinone backbone. Every modified compound was bound to a kind of MBL, imipenemase-1 (IMP-1), and the binding pose was optimized by a molecular mechanics calculation. The binding scores were evaluated for the respective optimized binding poses. Given the predicted binding poses and calculated binding scores, candidate compounds were determined for organic syntheses. The inhibitory activities of the synthesized compounds were measured by an in vitro assay for two kinds of MBLs, IMP-1 and New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (NDM-1). A quinolinone connected with an amine bound with methyl-phenyl-ether-propyl and cyclohexyl-ethyl showed a 50% inhibitory concentration of 4.8 \u03bcM. An X-ray crystal analysis clarified the binding structure of a synthesized compound to IMP-1. The \u03b4-lactam ring of quinolinone was hydrolyzed, and the generated carboxyl group was coordinated with zinc ions. The findings on the chemical structure and binding pose are expected to be a base for developing MBL inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Amyloids, proteinous aggregates with \u03b2-sheet-rich fibrils, are involved in several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease; thus, their detection is critically important. The most common fluorescent dye for amyloid detection is thioflavin-T (ThT), which shows on/off fluorescence upon amyloid binding. We previously reported that an engineered globular protein with a flat \u03b2-sheet, peptide self-assembly mimic (PSAM), can be used as an amyloid binding model. In this study, we further explored the residue-specific properties of ThT-binding to the flat \u03b2-sheet by introducing systematic mutations. We found that site-specific mutations at the ThT-binding channel enhanced affinity. We also evaluated the binding of a ThT-based photocatalyst, which showed the photooxygenation activity on the amyloid fibril upon light radiation. Upon binding of the photocatalyst to the PSAM variant, singlet oxygen-generating activity was observed. The results of this study expand our understanding of the detailed binding mechanism of amyloid-specific molecules.",

    "abstract": "MUS81 is a structure-selective endonuclease that cleaves various branched DNA structures arising from natural physiological processes such as homologous recombination and mitosis. Due to this, MUS81 is able to relieve replication stress, and its function has been reported to be critical to the survival of many cancers, particularly those with dysfunctional DNA-repair machinery. There is therefore interest in MUS81 as a cancer drug target, yet there are currently few small molecule inhibitors of this enzyme reported, and no liganded crystal structures are available to guide hit optimization. Here we report the fragment-based discovery of novel small molecule MUS81 inhibitors with sub-\u03bcM biochemical activity. These inhibitors were used to develop a novel crystal system, providing the first structural insight into the inhibition of MUS81 with small molecules.",

    "abstract": "ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport systems are crucial for bacteria to ensure sufficient uptake of nutrients that are not produced de novo or improve the energy balance. The cell surface of the pathobiont Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is decorated with a substantial array of ABC transporters, critically influencing nasopharyngeal colonization and invasive infections. Given the auxotrophic nature of pneumococci for certain amino acids, the Ami ABC transporter system, orchestrating oligopeptide uptake, becomes indispensable in host compartments lacking amino acids. The system comprises five exposed Oligopeptide Binding Proteins (OBPs) and four proteins building the ABC transporter channel. Here, we present a structural analysis of all the OBPs in this system. Multiple crystallographic structures, capturing both open and closed conformations along with complexes involving chemically synthesized peptides, have been solved at high resolution providing insights into the molecular basis of their diverse peptide specificities. Mass spectrometry analysis of oligopeptides demonstrates the unexpected remarkable promiscuity of some of these proteins when expressed in Escherichia coli, displaying affinity for a wide range of peptides. Finally, a model is proposed for the complete Ami transport system in complex with its various OBPs. We further disclosed, through in silico modelling, some essential structural changes facilitating oligopeptide transport into the cellular cytoplasm. Thus, the structural analysis of the Ami system provides valuable insights into the mechanism and specificity of oligopeptide binding by the different OBPs, shedding light on the intricacies of the uptake mechanism and the in vivo implications for this human pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Systematic analysis of molecular recognition is critical for understanding the biological function of macromolecules. For the immunomodulatory protein D-dopachrome tautomerase (D-DT), the mechanism of protein-ligand interactions is poorly understood. Here, 17 carefully designed protein variants and wild type (WT) D-DT were interrogated with an array of complementary techniques to elucidate the structural basis of ligand recognition. Utilization of a substrate and two selective inhibitors with distinct binding profiles offered previously unseen mechanistic insights into D-DT-ligand interactions. Our results demonstrate that the C-terminal region serves a key role in molecular recognition via regulation of the active site opening, protein-ligand interactions, and conformational flexibility of the pocket's environment. While our study is the first comprehensive analysis of molecular recognition for D-DT, the findings reported herein promote the understanding of protein functionality and enable the design of new structure-based drug discovery projects.",

    "abstract": "Microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) has emerged as a powerful technique for unraveling molecular structures from microcrystals too small for X-ray diffraction. However, a significant hurdle arises with plate-like crystals that consistently orient themselves flat on the electron microscopy grid. If the normal of the plate correlates with the axes of the crystal lattice, the crystal orientations accessible for measurement are restricted because the crystal cannot be arbitrarily rotated. This limits the information that can be acquired, resulting in a missing cone of information. We recently introduced a novel crystallization strategy called suspended drop crystallization and proposed that crystals in a suspended drop could effectively address the challenge of preferred crystal orientation. Here we demonstrate the success of the suspended drop approach in eliminating the missing cone in two samples that crystallize as thin plates: bovine liver catalase and the SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 main protease (Mpro). This innovative solution proves indispensable for crystals exhibiting systematic preferred orientations, unlocking new possibilities for structure determination by MicroED.",

Recently, a fluorophore named 5-((Z)-4-((2-hydroxyethyl)(methyl)amino)benzylidene)-3-methyl-2-((E)-styryl)-3,5-dihydro-4H-imidazol-4-one (NBSI), emitting in red spectrum, and its cognate aptamer named Clivia were identified, exhibiting a large Stokes shift. To explore the underlying molecular basis of this unique RNA-fluorophore complex, we determined the tertiary structure of Clivia-NBSI. The overall structure uses a monomeric, non-G-quadruplex compact coaxial architecture, with NBSI sandwiched at the core junction. Structure-based fluorophore recognition pattern analysis, combined with fluorescence assays, enables the orthogonal use of Clivia-NBSI and other fluorogenic aptamers, paving the way for both dual-emission fluorescence and bioluminescence imaging of RNA molecules within living cells. Furthermore, on the basis of the structure-based substitution assay, we developed a multivalent Clivia fluorogenic aptamer containing multiple minimal NBSI-binding modules. This innovative design notably enhances the recognition sensitivity of fluorophores both in vitro and in vivo, shedding light on future efficient applications in various biomedical and research contexts.",

Thogotoviruses, exemplified by Thogoto virus (THOV), are capable of infecting humans using ticks as vectors. THOV transcribes mRNA without the extraneous 5' end sequences derived from cap-snatching in influenza virus mRNA. Here, we report cryo-EM structures to characterize THOV polymerase RNA synthesis initiation and elongation. The structures demonstrate that THOV RNA transcription and replication are able to start with short dinucleotide primers and that the polymerase cap-snatching machinery is likely non-functional. Triggered by RNA synthesis, asymmetric THOV polymerase dimers can form without the involvement of host factors. We confirm that, distinctive from influenza viruses, THOV-polymerase RNA synthesis is weakly dependent of the host factors ANP32A/B/E in human cells. This study demonstrates varied mechanisms in RNA synthesis and host factor utilization among orthomyxoviruses, providing insights into the mechanisms behind thogotoviruses' broad-infectivity range.",

    "abstract": "The prime editor\u00a0system composed of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 nickase (nSpCas9) and engineered Moloney murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase (M-MLV RT) collaborates with a prime\u00a0editing guide RNA (pegRNA) to facilitate a wide variety of precise genome edits in living cells<sup>1</sup>. However, owing to a lack of structural information, the molecular mechanism of pegRNA-guided reverse transcription by the prime editor remains poorly understood. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of the SpCas9-M-MLV RT\u0394RNaseH-pegRNA-target DNA complex in multiple states. The termination structure, along with our functional analysis, reveals that M-MLV RT extends reverse transcription beyond the expected site, resulting in scaffold-derived incorporations that cause undesired edits at the target loci. Furthermore, structural comparisons among the pre-initiation, initiation and elongation states show that M-MLV RT remains in a consistent position relative to SpCas9 during reverse transcription, whereas the pegRNA-synthesized DNA heteroduplex builds up along the surface of SpCas9. On the basis of our structural insights, we rationally engineered pegRNA variants and prime-editor variants in which M-MLV RT is fused within SpCas9. Collectively, our findings provide structural insights into the stepwise mechanism of prime editing, and will pave the way for the development of a versatile prime\u00a0editing toolbox.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria play a pivotal part in ATP energy production through oxidative phosphorylation, which occurs within the inner membrane through a series of respiratory complexes<sup>1-4</sup>. Despite extensive in vitro structural studies, determining the atomic details of their molecular mechanisms in physiological states remains a major challenge, primarily because of loss of the native environment during purification. Here we directly image porcine mitochondria using an in situ cryo-electron microscopy approach. This enables us to determine the structures of various high-order assemblies of respiratory supercomplexes in their native states. We identify four main supercomplex organizations: I<sub>1</sub>III<sub>2</sub>IV<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>1</sub>III<sub>2</sub>IV<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>III<sub>2</sub>IV<sub>2</sub> and I<sub>2</sub>III<sub>4</sub>IV<sub>2</sub>, which potentially expand into higher-order arrays on the inner membranes. These diverse supercomplexes are largely formed by 'protein-lipids-protein' interactions, which in turn have a substantial impact on the local geometry of the surrounding membranes. Our in situ structures also capture numerous reactive intermediates within these respiratory supercomplexes, shedding light on the dynamic processes of the ubiquinone/ubiquinol exchange mechanism in complex I and the Q-cycle in complex III. Structural comparison of supercomplexes from mitochondria treated under different conditions indicates a possible correlation between conformational states of complexes I and III, probably in response to environmental changes. By preserving the native membrane environment, our approach enables structural studies of mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes in reaction at high resolution across multiple scales, from atomic-level details to the broader subcellular context.",

However, the detailed formation mechanisms of NCs or NPs directed by protein templates remain unclear. In this study, by taking advantage of the ferritin nanocage as a biotemplate to monitor the growth of Fe-O NCs as a function of time, we synthesized a series of iron NCs with different sizes and shapes and subsequently solved their corresponding three-dimensional atomic-scale structures by X-ray protein crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. The time-dependent structure analyses revealed the growth process of these Fe-O NCs with the 4-fold channel of ferritin as nucleation sites. To our knowledge, the newly biosynthesized Fe<sub>35</sub>O<sub>23</sub>Glu<sub>12</sub> represents the largest Fe-O NCs with a definite atomic structure. This study contributes to our understanding of the formation mechanism of iron NCs and provides an effective method for metal NC synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Chalcone synthase (CHS) and chalcone isomerase (CHI) catalyze the first two committed steps of the flavonoid pathway that plays a pivotal role in the growth and reproduction of land plants, including UV protection, pigmentation, symbiotic nitrogen fixation, and pathogen resistance. Based on the obtained X-ray crystal structures of CHS, CHI, and chalcone isomerase-like protein (CHIL) from the same monocotyledon, <i>Panicum virgatum</i>, along with the results of the steady-state kinetics, spectroscopic/thermodynamic analyses, intermolecular interactions, and their effect on each catalytic step are proposed. In addition, PvCHI's unique activity for both naringenin chalcone and isoliquiritigenin was analyzed, and the observed hierarchical activity for those type-I and -II substrates was explained with the intrinsic characteristics of the enzyme and two substrates. The structure of PvCHS complexed with naringenin supports uncompetitive inhibition. PvCHS displays intrinsic catalytic promiscuity, evident from the formation of <i>p</i>-coumaroyltriacetic acid lactone (CTAL) in addition to naringenin chalcone. In the presence of PvCHIL, conversion of <i>p</i>-coumaroyl-CoA to naringenin through PvCHS and PvCHI displayed ~400-fold increased <i>V<sub>max</sub></i> with reduced formation of CTAL by 70%. Supporting this model, molecular docking, ITC (Isothermal Titration Calorimetry), and FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer) indicated that both PvCHI and PvCHIL interact with PvCHS in a non-competitive manner, indicating the plausible allosteric effect of naringenin on CHS. Significantly, the presence of naringenin increased the affinity between PvCHS and PvCHIL, whereas naringenin chalcone decreased the affinity, indicating a plausible feedback mechanism to minimize spontaneous incorrect stereoisomers. These are the first findings from a three-body system from the same species, indicating the importance of the macromolecular assembly of CHS-CHI-CHIL in determining the amount and type of flavonoids produced in plant cells.",

    "abstract": "Channel enzymes represent a class of ion channels with enzymatic activity directly or indirectly linked to their channel function. We investigated a TRPM2 chanzyme from choanoflagellates that integrates two seemingly incompatible functions into a single peptide: a channel module activated by ADP-ribose with high open probability and an enzyme module (NUDT9-H domain) consuming ADP-ribose at a remarkably slow rate. Using time-resolved cryogenic-electron microscopy, we captured a complete series of structural snapshots of gating and catalytic cycles, revealing the coupling mechanism between channel gating and enzymatic activity. The slow kinetics of the NUDT9-H enzyme module confers a self-regulatory mechanism: ADPR binding triggers NUDT9-H tetramerization, promoting channel opening, while subsequent hydrolysis reduces local ADPR, inducing channel closure. We further demonstrated how the NUDT9-H domain has evolved from a structurally semi-independent ADP-ribose hydrolase module in early species to a fully integrated component of a gating ring essential for channel activation in advanced species.",

    "abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have gradually dominated the drug markets for various diseases. Improvement of the therapeutic activities of mAbs has become a critical issue in the pharmaceutical industry. A novel endo-\u03b2-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosaminidase, EndoSz, from <i><i>Streptococcus equi</i>subsp. zooepidemicus Sz105</i> is discovered and applied to enhance the activities of mAbs. Our studies demonstrate that the mutant EndoSz-D234M possesses an excellent transglycosylation activity to generate diverse glycoconjugates on mAbs. We prove that EndoSz-D234M can be applied to various marketed therapeutic antibodies and those in development for antibody remodeling. The remodeled homogeneous antibodies (mAb-G2S2) produced by EndoSz-D234M increase the relative ADCC activities by 3-26-fold. We further report the high-resolution crystal structures of EndoSz-D234M in the <i>apo</i>-form at 2.15 \u00c5 and the complex form with a bound G2S2-oxazoline intermediate at 2.25 \u00c5. A novel pH-jump method was utilized to obtain the complex structure with a high resolution. The detailed interactions of EndoSz-D234M and the carried G2S2-oxazoline are hence delineated. The oxazoline sits in a hole, named the oxa-hole, which stabilizes the G2S2-oxazoline in transit and catalyzes the further transglycosylation reaction while targeting Asn-GlcNAc (+1) of Fc. In the oxa-hole, the H-bonding network involved with oxazoline dominates the transglycosylation activity. A mobile loop2 (a.a. 152-159) of EndoSz-D234M reshapes the binding grooves for the accommodation of G2S2-oxazoline upon binding, at which Trp154 forms a hydrogen bond with Man (-2). The long loop4 (a.a. 236-248) followed by helix3 is capable of dominating the substrate selectivity of EndoSz-D234M. In addition, the stepwise transglycosylation behavior of EndoSz-D234M is elucidated. Based on the high-resolution structures of the <i>apo</i>-form and the bound form with G2S2-oxazoline as well as a systematic mutagenesis study of the relative transglycosylation activity, the transglycosylation mechanism of EndoSz-D234M is revealed.",

    "abstract": "The biologically active metabolite of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> - calcitriol - is a hormone involved in the regulation of calcium-phosphate homeostasis, immunological processes and cell differentiation, being therefore essential for the proper functioning of the human body. This suggests many applications of this steroid in the treatment of diseases such as rickets, psoriasis and some cancers. Unfortunately, using therapeutic doses of calcitriol is associated with high concentrations of this compound which causes hypercalcemia. For this reason, new calcitriol analogs are constantly sought, devoid of calcemic effects but maintaining its beneficial properties. In this study, we present the synthesis of vitamin D derivatives characterized by an enlarged (seven-membered) ring D. Preparation of the designed vitamin D compounds required separate syntheses of crucial building blocks (C/D-rings fragments with side chain and rings A) which were combined by different methods, including Wittig-Horner reaction and Suzuki coupling. Biological activities of the target vitamin D analogs were assessed both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating their significant potency compared to the natural hormone. Furthermore, the successful crystallization of these compounds with the vitamin D receptor (VDR) enabled us to investigate additional molecular interactions with this protein.",

    "abstract": "Seasonal and pandemic-associated influenza strains cause highly contagious viral respiratory infections that can lead to severe illness and excess mortality. Here, we report on the optimization of our small-molecule inhibitor F0045(S) targeting the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) stem with our Sulfur-Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) click chemistry-based high-throughput medicinal chemistry (HTMC) strategy. A combination of SuFEx- and amide-based lead molecule diversification and structure-guided design led to identification and validation of ultrapotent influenza fusion inhibitors with subnanomolar EC<sub>50</sub> cellular antiviral activity against several influenza A group 1 strains. X-ray structures of six of these compounds with HA indicate that the appended moieties occupy additional pockets on the HA surface and increase the binding interaction, where the accumulation of several polar interactions also contributes to the improved affinity. The compounds here represent the most potent HA small-molecule inhibitors to date. Our divergent HTMC platform is therefore a powerful, rapid, and cost-effective approach to develop bioactive chemical probes and drug-like candidates against viral targets.",

However, the kinetic parameters provide little information on the atomic mechanism of the reaction. In this study, we analyzed structures of glutamate dehydrogenase in the initial and steady stages of the reaction using cryoEM at near-atomic resolution. In the initial stage, four metastable conformations displayed different domain motions and cofactor/ligand association modes. The most striking finding was that the enzyme-cofactor-substrate complex, treated as a single state in the enzyme kinetic theory, comprised at least three different metastable conformations. In the steady stage, seven conformations, including derivatives from the four conformations in the initial stage, made the reaction pathway complicated. Based on the visualized conformations, we discussed stage-dependent pathways to illustrate the dynamics of the enzyme in action.",

    "abstract": "Aromatic amino acids and their derivatives are diverse primary and secondary metabolites with critical roles in protein synthesis, cell structure and integrity, defense and signaling. All de novo aromatic amino acid production relies on a set of ancient and highly conserved chemistries. Here we introduce a new enzymatic transformation for L-tyrosine synthesis by demonstrating that the \u03b2-subunit of tryptophan synthase-which natively couples indole and L-serine to form L-tryptophan-can act as a latent 'tyrosine synthase'. A single substitution of a near-universally conserved catalytic residue unlocks activity toward simple phenol analogs and yields exclusive para carbon-carbon bond formation to furnish L-tyrosines. Structural and mechanistic studies show how a new active-site water molecule orients phenols for a nonnative mechanism of alkylation, with additional directed evolution resulting in a net >30,000-fold rate enhancement. This new biocatalyst can be used to efficiently prepare valuable L-tyrosine analogs at gram scales and provides the missing chemistry for a conceptually different pathway to L-tyrosine.",

Firstly, we obtain the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 structure at 3\u00a0\u00c5 resolution in the inactive state, revealing the overall topology of the heterodimer with the transmembrane (TM) helices and the ligand-binding domain tucked in a specific angle proximity to the TM region. After the addition of a Mn<sup>2+</sup> agonist, we resolve two coexisting structures representing two new states between inactive and active state. Our structures show conformational changes of the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activating trajectory and a unique twisting of the integrin legs, which is required for platelets accumulation. Our structure provides direct structural evidence for how the lower legs are involved in full-length integrin activation mechanisms and offers a new strategy to target the \u03b1IIb\u03b23 lower leg.",

    "abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) play pivotal roles in various physiological processes. These receptors are activated to different extents by diverse orthosteric ligands and allosteric modulators. However, the mechanisms underlying these variations in signaling activity by allosteric modulators remain largely elusive. Here, we determine the three-dimensional structure of the \u03bc-opioid receptor (MOR), a class A GPCR, in complex with the G<sub>i</sub> protein and an allosteric modulator, BMS-986122, using cryogenic electron microscopy. Our results reveal that BMS-986122 binding induces changes in the map densities corresponding to R167<sup>3.50</sup> and Y254<sup>5.58</sup>, key residues in the structural motifs conserved among class A GPCRs. Nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of MOR in the absence of the G<sub>i</sub> protein reveal that BMS-986122 binding enhances the formation of the interaction between R167<sup>3.50</sup> and Y254<sup>5.58</sup>, thus stabilizing the fully-activated conformation, where the intracellular half of TM6 is outward-shifted to allow for interaction with the G<sub>i</sub> protein. These findings illuminate that allosteric modulators like BMS-986122 can potentiate receptor activation through alterations in the conformational dynamics in the core region of GPCRs. Together, our results demonstrate the regulatory mechanisms of GPCRs, providing insights into the rational development of therapeutics targeting GPCRs.",

    "abstract": "Psychedelic substances such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin show potential for the treatment of various neuropsychiatric disorders<sup>1-3</sup>. These compounds are thought to mediate their hallucinogenic and therapeutic effects through the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) receptor 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> (ref. <sup>4</sup>). However, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> also plays a part in the behavioural effects of tryptamine hallucinogens<sup>5</sup>, particularly 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT), a psychedelic found in the toxin of Colorado River toads<sup>6</sup>. Although 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> is a validated therapeutic target<sup>7,8</sup>, little is known about how psychedelics engage 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and which effects are mediated by this receptor. Here we map the molecular underpinnings of 5-MeO-DMT pharmacology through five cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM)\u00a0structures of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, systematic medicinal chemistry, receptor mutagenesis and mouse behaviour. Structure-activity relationship analyses of 5-methoxytryptamines at both 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> enable the characterization of molecular determinants of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> signalling potency, efficacy and selectivity. Moreover, we contrast the structural interactions and in vitro pharmacology of 5-MeO-DMT and analogues to the pan-serotonergic agonist LSD and clinically used 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> agonists. We show that a 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>-selective 5-MeO-DMT analogue is devoid of hallucinogenic-like effects while retaining anxiolytic-like and antidepressant-like activity in socially defeated animals. Our studies uncover molecular aspects of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>-targeted psychedelics and therapeutics, which may facilitate the future development of new medications for neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a cyclic neuropeptide that regulates food intake, energy balance, and other physiological functions by stimulating MCHR1 and MCHR2 receptors, both of which are class A G protein-coupled receptors. MCHR1 predominately couples to inhibitory G protein, G<sub>i/o</sub>, and MCHR2 can only couple to G<sub>q/11</sub>. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of MCH-activated MCHR1 with G<sub>i</sub> and MCH-activated MCHR2 with G<sub>q</sub> at the global resolutions of 3.01 \u00c5 and 2.40\u2009\u00c5, respectively. These structures reveal that MCH adopts a consistent cysteine-mediated hairpin loop configuration when bound to both receptors. A central arginine from the LGRVY core motif between the two cysteines of MCH penetrates deeply into the transmembrane pocket, triggering receptor activation. Integrated with mutational and functional insights, our findings elucidate the molecular underpinnings of ligand recognition and MCH receptor activation and offer a structural foundation for targeted drug design.",

Fapy\u2022dG preferentially gives rise to G \u2192 T transversions and G \u2192 A transitions. However, the molecular basis by which Fapy\u2022dG is processed by DNA polymerases during this mutagenic process remains poorly understood. To address this we investigated how DNA polymerase \u03b2 (Pol \u03b2), a model mammalian polymerase, bypasses a templating Fapy\u2022dG, inserts Fapy\u2022dGTP, and extends from Fapy\u2022dG at the primer terminus. When Fapy\u2022dG is present in the template, Pol \u03b2 incorporates TMP less efficiently than either dCMP or dAMP. Kinetic analysis revealed that Fapy\u2022dGTP is a poor substrate but is incorporated \u223c3-times more efficiently opposite dA than dC. Extension from Fapy\u2022dG at the 3'-terminus of a nascent primer is inefficient due to the primer terminus being poorly positioned for catalysis. Together these data indicate that mutagenic bypass of Fapy\u2022dG is likely to be the source of the mutagenic effects of the lesion and not Fapy\u2022dGTP. These experiments increase our understanding of the promutagenic effects of Fapy\u2022dG.",

Brassinosteroids are synthesized in the cell interior but bind receptors at the cell surface, necessitating a yet to be identified export mechanism. Here, we show that a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily, ABCB19, functions as a brassinosteroid exporter. We present its structure in both the substrate-unbound and the brassinosteroid-bound states. Bioactive brassinosteroids are potent activators of ABCB19 ATP hydrolysis activity, and transport assays showed that ABCB19 transports brassinosteroids. In <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, ABCB19 and its close homolog, ABCB1, positively regulate brassinosteroid responses. Our results uncover an elusive export mechanism for bioactive brassinosteroids that is tightly coordinated with brassinosteroid signaling.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorylation plays a crucial role in the regulation of many fundamental cellular processes. Phosphorylation levels are increased in many cancer cells where they may promote changes in mitochondrial homeostasis. Proteomic studies on various types of cancer identified 17 phosphorylation sites within the human ATP-dependent protease Lon, which degrades misfolded, unassembled and oxidatively damaged proteins in mitochondria. Most of these sites were found in Lon's N-terminal (NTD) and ATPase domains, though little is known about the effects on their function. By combining the biochemical and cryo-electron microscopy studies, we show the effect of Tyr186 and Tyr394 phosphorylations in Lon's NTD, which greatly reduce all Lon activities without affecting its ability to bind substrates or perturbing its tertiary structure. A substantial reduction in Lon's activities is also observed in the presence of polyphosphate, whose amount significantly increases in cancer cells. Our study thus provides an insight into the possible fine-tuning of Lon activities in human diseases, which highlights Lon's importance in maintaining proteostasis in mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "Tertiary chirality describes the handedness of supramolecular assemblies and relies not only on the primary and secondary structures of the building blocks but also on topological driving forces that have been sparsely characterized. Helical biopolymers, especially DNA, have been extensively investigated as they possess intrinsic chirality that determines the optical, mechanical, and physical properties of the ensuing material. Here, we employ the DNA tensegrity triangle as a model system to locate the tipping points in chirality inversion at the tertiary level by X-ray diffraction. We engineer tensegrity triangle crystals with incremental rotational steps between immobile junctions from 3 to 28 base pairs (bp). We construct a mathematical model that accurately predicts and explains the molecular configurations in both this work and previous studies. Our design framework is extendable to other supramolecular assemblies of helical biopolymers and can be used in the design of chiral nanomaterials, optically active molecules, and mesoporous frameworks, all of which are of interest to physical, biological, and chemical nanoscience.",

Given its close association with glutamate/glycine co-activated NMDA receptors (NMDARs), GlyT1 has emerged as a central target for the treatment of schizophrenia, which is often linked to hypofunctional NMDARs. Here, we report the cryo-EM structures of GlyT1 bound with substrate glycine and drugs ALX-5407, SSR504734, and PF-03463275. These structures, captured at three fundamental states of the transport cycle-outward-facing, occluded, and inward-facing-enable us to illustrate a comprehensive blueprint of the conformational change associated with glycine reuptake. Additionally, we identified three specific pockets accommodating drugs, providing clear insights into the structural basis of their inhibitory mechanism and selectivity. Collectively, these structures offer significant insights into the transport mechanism and recognition of substrate and anti-schizophrenia drugs, thus providing a platform to design small molecules to treat schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Transthyretin amyloidosis is a fatal disorder caused by transthyretin amyloid aggregation. Stabilizing the native structure of transthyretin is an effective approach to inhibit amyloid aggregation. To develop kinetic stabilizers of transthyretin, it is crucial to explore compounds that selectively bind to transthyretin in plasma. Our recent findings demonstrated that the uricosuric agent benziodarone selectively binds to transthyretin in plasma. Here, we report the development of benziodarone analogues with enhanced potency for selective binding to transthyretin in plasma compared to benziodarone. These analogues featured substituents of chlorine, bromine, iodine, a methyl group, or a trifluoromethyl group, at the 4-position of the benzofuran ring. X-ray crystal structure analysis revealed that CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds and a halogen bond are important for the binding of the compounds to the thyroxine-binding sites. The bioavailability of benziodarone analogues with 4-Br, 4-Cl, or 4-CH<sub>3</sub> was comparable to that of tafamidis, a current therapeutic agent for transthyretin amyloidosis.",

AQs from the entomopathogenic bacterium Photorhabdus laumondii are produced by a modular type II polyketide synthase system. A key enzyme involved in AQ biosynthesis is PlAntI, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of the bicyclic-intermediate-loaded acyl carrier protein, polyketide trimming, and assembly of the aromatic AQ scaffold. Here, multiple crystal structures of PlAntI in various conformations and with bound substrate surrogates or inhibitors are reported. Structure-based mutagenesis and activity assays provide experimental insights into the three sequential reaction steps to yield the natural product AQ-256. For comparison, a series of ligand-complex structures of two functionally related hydrolases involved in the biosynthesis of 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin in pathogenic fungi is determined. These data provide fundamental insights into the mechanism of polyketide trimming that shapes pigments in pro- and eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Interaction of transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family members with class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) has been implicated in a wide variety of diseases. Though considerable knowledge on this topic has been accumulated over the years, a high resolution and detailed analysis of the binding mode of multiple class IIa HDAC derived peptides with MEF2D is still lacking. To fulfil this gap, we report here the crystal structure of MEF2D in complex with double strand DNA and four different class IIa HDAC derived peptides, namely HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7 and HDAC9. All class IIa HDAC derived peptides form extended amphipathic \u03b1-helix structures that fit snugly in the hydrophobic groove of MEF2D domain. Binding mode of class IIa HDAC derived peptides to MEF2D is very similar and occur primarily through nonpolar interactions mediated by highly conserved branched hydrophobic amino acids. Further studies revealed that class IIa HDAC derived peptides are unstructured in solution and appear to adopt a folded \u03b1-helix structure only upon binding to MEF2D. Comparison of our peptide-protein complexes with previously characterized structures of MEF2 bound to different co-activators and co-repressors, highlighted both differences and similarities, and revealed the adaptability of MEF2 in protein-protein interactions. The elucidation of the three-dimensional structure of MEF2D in complex with multiple class IIa HDAC derived peptides provide not only a better understanding of the molecular basis of their interactions but also have implications for the development of novel antagonist.",

    "abstract": "The human organic cation transporter 1 (hOCT1), also known as SLC22A1, is integral to hepatic uptake of structurally diversified endogenous and exogenous organic cations, influencing both metabolism and drug pharmacokinetics. hOCT1 has been implicated in the therapeutic dynamics of many drugs, making interactions with hOCT1 a key consideration in novel drug development and drug-drug interactions. Notably, metformin, the frontline medication for type 2 diabetes, is a prominent hOCT1 substrate. Conversely, hOCT1 can be inhibited by agents such as spironolactone, a steroid analog inhibitor of the aldosterone receptor, necessitating a deep understanding of hOCT1-drug interactions in the development of new pharmacological treatments. Despite extensive study, specifics of hOCT1 transport and inhibition mechanisms remain elusive at the molecular level. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of the hOCT1-metformin complex in three distinct conformational states - outward open, outward occluded, and inward occluded as well as substrate-free hOCT1 in both partially and fully open states. We also present hOCT1 in complex with spironolactone in both outward and inward facing conformations. These structures provide atomic-level insights into the dynamic metformin transfer process via hOCT1 and the mechanism by which spironolactone inhibits it. Additionally, we identify a 'YER' motif critical for the conformational flexibility of hOCT1 and likely other SLC22 family transporters. Our findings significantly advance the understanding of hOCT1 molecular function and offer a foundational framework for the design of new therapeutic agents targeting this transporter.",

    "abstract": "The marine cyanobacterium <i>Prochlorococcus</i> is a main contributor to global photosynthesis, whilst being limited by iron availability. Cyanobacterial genomes generally encode two different types of FutA iron-binding proteins: periplasmic FutA2 ABC transporter subunits bind Fe(III), while cytosolic FutA1 binds Fe(II). Owing to their small size and their economized genome <i>Prochlorococcus</i> ecotypes typically possess a single <i>futA</i> gene. How the encoded FutA protein might bind different Fe oxidation states was previously unknown. Here, we use structural biology techniques at room temperature to probe the dynamic behavior of FutA. Neutron diffraction confirmed four negatively charged tyrosinates, that together with a neutral water molecule coordinate iron in trigonal bipyramidal geometry. Positioning of the positively charged Arg103 side chain in the second coordination shell yields an overall charge-neutral Fe(III) binding state in structures determined by neutron diffraction and serial femtosecond crystallography. Conventional rotation X-ray crystallography using a home source revealed X-ray-induced photoreduction of the iron center with observation of the Fe(II) binding state; here, an additional positioning of the Arg203 side chain in the second coordination shell maintained an overall charge neutral Fe(II) binding site. Dose series using serial synchrotron crystallography and an XFEL X-ray pump-probe approach capture the transition between Fe(III) and Fe(II) states, revealing how Arg203 operates as a switch to accommodate the different iron oxidation states. This switching ability of the <i>Prochlorococcus</i> FutA protein may reflect ecological adaptation by genome streamlining and loss of specialized FutA proteins.",

    "abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) activate heterotrimeric G proteins by stimulating guanine nucleotide exchange in the G\u03b1 subunit<sup>1</sup>. To visualize this mechanism, we developed a time-resolved cryo-EM approach that examines the progression of ensembles of pre-steady-state intermediates of a GPCR-G-protein complex. By monitoring the transitions of the stimulatory G<sub>s</sub> protein in complex with the \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor at short sequential time points after GTP addition, we identified the conformational trajectory underlying G-protein activation and functional dissociation from the receptor. Twenty structures generated from sequential overlapping particle subsets along this trajectory, compared to control structures, provide a high-resolution description of the order of main events driving G-protein activation in response to GTP binding. Structural changes propagate from the nucleotide-binding pocket and extend through the GTPase domain, enacting alterations to G\u03b1 switch regions and the \u03b15 helix that weaken the G-protein-receptor interface. Molecular dynamics simulations with late structures in the cryo-EM trajectory support that enhanced ordering of GTP on closure of the \u03b1-helical domain against the nucleotide-bound Ras-homology domain correlates with \u03b15 helix destabilization and eventual dissociation of the G protein from the GPCR. These findings also highlight the potential of time-resolved cryo-EM as a tool for mechanistic dissection of GPCR signalling events.",

    "abstract": "Banna virus (BAV) is the prototype Seadornavirus, a class of reoviruses for which there has been little structural study. Here, we report atomic cryo-EM structures of three states of BAV virions-surrounded by 120 spikes (full virions), 60 spikes (partial virions), or no spikes (cores). BAV cores are double-layered particles similar to the cores of other non-turreted reoviruses, except for an additional protein component in the outer capsid shell, VP10. VP10 was identified to be a cementing protein that plays a pivotal role in the assembly of BAV virions by directly interacting with VP2 (inner capsid), VP8 (outer capsid), and VP4 (spike). Viral spikes (VP4/VP9 heterohexamers) are situated on top of VP10 molecules in full or partial virions. Asymmetrical electrostatic interactions between VP10 monomers and VP4 trimers are disrupted by high pH treatment, which is thus a simple way to produce BAV cores. Low pH treatment of BAV virions removes only the flexible receptor binding protein VP9 and triggers significant conformational changes in the membrane penetration protein VP4. BAV virions adopt distinct spatial organization of their surface proteins compared with other well-studied reoviruses, suggesting that BAV may have a unique mechanism of penetration of cellular endomembranes.",

Gabija is a highly widespread prokaryotic defence system that consists of two components, GajA and GajB<sup>8</sup>. GajA functions as a DNA endonuclease that is inactive in the presence of ATP<sup>9</sup>. Here, to explore how the Gabija system is activated for anti-phage defence, we report its cryo-electron microscopy structures in five states, including apo GajA, GajA in complex with DNA, GajA bound by ATP, apo GajA-GajB, and GajA-GajB in complex with ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. GajA is a rhombus-shaped tetramer with its ATPase domain clustered at the centre and the topoisomerase-primase (Toprim) domain located peripherally. ATP binding at the ATPase domain stabilizes the insertion region within the ATPase domain, keeping the Toprim domain in a closed state. Upon ATP depletion by phages, the Toprim domain opens to bind and cleave the DNA substrate. GajB, which docks on GajA, is activated by the cleaved DNA, ultimately leading to prokaryotic cell death. Our study presents a mechanistic landscape of Gabija activation.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitously expressed protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 is required for signaling downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and plays a role in regulating many cellular processes. Genetic knockdown and pharmacological inhibition of SHP2 suppresses RAS/MAPK signaling and inhibit the proliferation of RTK-driven cancer cell lines. Here, we describe the first reported fragment-to-lead campaign against SHP2, where X-ray crystallography and biophysical techniques were used to identify fragments binding to multiple sites on SHP2. Structure-guided optimization, including several computational methods, led to the discovery of two structurally distinct series of SHP2 inhibitors binding to the previously reported allosteric tunnel binding site (Tunnel Site). One of these series was advanced to a low-nanomolar lead that inhibited tumor growth when dosed orally to mice bearing HCC827 xenografts. Furthermore, a third series of SHP2 inhibitors was discovered binding to a previously unreported site, lying at the interface of the C-terminal SH2 and catalytic domains.",

Here, we establish a novel cancer-specific anti-HER2 antibody, H<sub>2</sub>Mab-214. H<sub>2</sub>Mab-214 reacts with HER2 on cancer cells, but unlike the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab, it does not react with HER2 on normal cells in flow cytometry measurements. A crystal structure suggests that H<sub>2</sub>Mab-214 recognizes a structurally disrupted region in the HER2 domain IV, which normally forms a \u03b2-sheet. We show that this misfolding is inducible by site-directed mutagenesis mimicking the disulfide bond defects that also may occur in cancer cells, indicating that the local misfolding in the Cys-rich domain IV governs the cancer-specificity of H<sub>2</sub>Mab-214. Furthermore, we show that H<sub>2</sub>Mab-214 effectively suppresses tumor growth in xenograft mouse models. Our findings offer a potential strategy for developing cancer-specific therapeutic antibodies that target partially misfolded cell surface receptors.",

    "abstract": "Transcription termination factor \u03c1 is a hexameric, RNA-dependent NTPase that can adopt active closed-ring and inactive open-ring conformations. The Sm-like protein Rof, a homolog of the RNA chaperone Hfq, inhibits \u03c1-dependent termination in vivo but recapitulation of this activity in vitro has proven difficult and the precise mode of Rof action is presently unknown. Here, our cryo-EM structures of \u03c1-Rof and \u03c1-RNA complexes show that Rof undergoes pronounced conformational changes to bind \u03c1 at the protomer interfaces, undercutting \u03c1 conformational dynamics associated with ring closure and occluding extended primary RNA-binding sites that are also part of interfaces between \u03c1 and RNA polymerase. Consistently, Rof impedes \u03c1 ring closure, \u03c1-RNA interactions and \u03c1 association with transcription elongation complexes. Structure-guided mutagenesis coupled with functional assays confirms that the observed \u03c1-Rof interface is required for Rof-mediated inhibition of cell growth and \u03c1-termination in vitro. Bioinformatic analyses reveal that Rof is restricted to Pseudomonadota and that the \u03c1-Rof interface is conserved. Genomic contexts of rof differ between Enterobacteriaceae and Vibrionaceae, suggesting distinct modes of Rof regulation. We hypothesize that Rof and other cellular anti-terminators silence \u03c1 under diverse, but yet to be identified, stress conditions when unrestrained transcription termination by \u03c1 may be detrimental.",

    "abstract": "DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A- and DNMT3B-mediated DNA methylation critically regulate epigenomic and transcriptomic patterning during development. The hotspot DNMT3A mutations at the site of Arg822 (R882) promote polymerization, leading to aberrant DNA methylation that may contribute to the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the molecular basis underlying the mutation-induced functional misregulation of DNMT3A remains unclear. Here, we report the crystal structures of the DNMT3A methyltransferase domain, revealing a molecular basis for its oligomerization behavior distinct to DNMT3B, and the enhanced intermolecular contacts caused by the R882H or R882C mutation. Our biochemical, cellular, and genomic DNA methylation analyses demonstrate that introducing the DNMT3B-converting mutations inhibits the R882H-/R882C-triggered DNMT3A polymerization and enhances substrate access, thereby eliminating the dominant-negative effect of the DNMT3A R882 mutations in cells. Together, this study provides mechanistic insights into DNMT3A R882 mutations-triggered aberrant oligomerization and DNA hypomethylation in AML, with important implications in cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) serves as a bacterial second messenger that modulates various processes including biofilm formation, motility, and host-microbe symbiosis. Numerous studies have conducted comprehensive analysis of c-di-GMP. However, the mechanisms by which certain environmental signals such as iron control intracellular c-di-GMP levels are unclear. Here, we show that iron regulates c-di-GMP levels in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by modulating the interaction between an iron-sensing protein, IsmP, and a diguanylate cyclase, ImcA. Binding of iron to the CHASE4 domain of IsmP inhibits the IsmP-ImcA interaction, which leads to increased c-di-GMP synthesis by ImcA, thus promoting biofilm formation and reducing bacterial motility. Structural characterization of the apo-CHASE4 domain and its binding to iron allows us to pinpoint residues defining its specificity. In addition, the cryo-electron microscopy structure of ImcA in complex with a c-di-GMP analog (GMPCPP) suggests a unique conformation in which the compound binds to the catalytic pockets and to the membrane-proximal side located at the cytoplasm. Thus, our results indicate that a CHASE4 domain directly senses iron and modulates the crosstalk between c-di-GMP metabolic enzymes.",

We determined cryoelectron microscopy structures of LayV F, in the prefusion and postfusion states, and of LayV G, revealing their conformational landscape and distinct antigenicity relative to NiV and HeV. We computationally designed stabilized LayV G constructs and demonstrate the generalizability of an HNV F prefusion-stabilization strategy. Our data will support the development of vaccines and therapeutics against LayV and closely related HNVs.",

    "abstract": "RfaH, a paralog of the universally conserved NusG, binds to RNA polymerases (RNAP) and ribosomes to activate expression of virulence genes. In free, autoinhibited RfaH, an \u03b1-helical KOW domain sequesters the RNAP-binding site. Upon recruitment to RNAP paused at an ops site, KOW is released and refolds into a \u03b2-barrel, which binds the ribosome. Here, we report structures of ops-paused transcription elongation complexes alone and bound to the autoinhibited and activated RfaH, which reveal swiveled, pre-translocated pause states stabilized by an ops hairpin in the non-template DNA. Autoinhibited RfaH binds and twists the ops hairpin, expanding the RNA:DNA hybrid to 11 base pairs and triggering the KOW release. Once activated, RfaH hyper-stabilizes the pause, which thus requires anti-backtracking factors for escape. Our results suggest that the entire RfaH cycle is solely determined by the ops and RfaH sequences and provide insights into mechanisms of recruitment and metamorphosis of NusG homologs across all life.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria use large antenna complexes called phycobilisomes (PBSs) for light harvesting. However, intense light triggers non-photochemical quenching, where the orange carotenoid protein (OCP) binds to PBS, dissipating excess energy as heat. The mechanism of efficiently transferring energy from phycocyanobilins in PBS to canthaxanthin in OCP remains insufficiently understood. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we unveiled the OCP-PBS complex structure at 1.6- to 2.1-angstrom resolution, showcasing its inherent flexibility. Using multiscale quantum chemistry, we disclosed the quenching mechanism. Identifying key protein residues, we clarified how canthaxanthin's transition dipole moment in its lowest-energy dark state becomes large enough for efficient energy transfer from phycocyanobilins. Our energy transfer model offers a detailed understanding of the atomic determinants of light harvesting regulation and antenna architecture in cyanobacteria.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A viruses, causing seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics, rely on interactions with host proteins for their RNA genome transcription and replication. The viral RNA polymerase utilizes host RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and interacts with the serine 5 phosphorylated (pS5) C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II to initiate transcription. Our study, using single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM), reveals the structure of the 1918 pandemic influenza A virus polymerase bound to a synthetic pS5 CTD peptide composed of four heptad repeats mimicking the 52 heptad repeat mammalian Pol II CTD. The structure shows that the CTD peptide binds at the C-terminal domain of the PA viral polymerase subunit (PA-C) and reveals a previously unobserved position of the 627 domain of the PB2 subunit near the CTD. We identify crucial residues of the CTD peptide that mediate interactions with positively charged cavities on PA-C, explaining the preference of the viral polymerase for pS5 CTD. Functional analysis of mutants targeting the CTD-binding site within PA-C reveals reduced transcriptional function or defects in replication, highlighting the multifunctional role of PA-C in viral RNA synthesis. Our study provides insights into the structural and functional aspects of the influenza virus polymerase-host Pol II interaction and identifies a target for antiviral development.IMPORTANCEUnderstanding the intricate interactions between influenza A viruses and host proteins is crucial for developing targeted antiviral strategies. This study employs advanced imaging techniques to uncover the structural nuances of the 1918 pandemic influenza A virus polymerase bound to a specific host protein, shedding light on the vital process of viral RNA synthesis. The study identifies key amino acid residues in the influenza polymerase involved in binding host polymerase II (Pol II) and highlights their role in both viral transcription and genome replication. These findings not only deepen our understanding of the influenza virus life cycle but also pinpoint a potential target for antiviral development. By elucidating the structural and functional aspects of the influenza virus polymerase-host Pol II interaction, this research provides a foundation for designing interventions to disrupt viral replication and transcription, offering promising avenues for future antiviral therapies.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in PINK1 and Parkin cause early-onset Parkinson's Disease (PD). PINK1 is a kinase which functions as a mitochondrial damage sensor and initiates mitochondrial quality control by accumulating on the damaged organelle. There, it phosphorylates ubiquitin, which in turn recruits and activates Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Ubiquitylation of mitochondrial proteins leads to the autophagic degradation of the damaged organelle. Pharmacological modulation of PINK1 constitutes an appealing avenue to study its physiological function and develop therapeutics. In this study, we used a thermal shift assay with insect PINK1 to identify small molecules that inhibit ATP hydrolysis and ubiquitin phosphorylation. PRT062607, an SYK inhibitor, is the most potent inhibitor in our screen and inhibits both insect and human PINK1, with an IC<sub>50</sub> in the 0.5-3\u00a0\u00b5M range in HeLa cells and dopaminergic neurons. The crystal structures of insect PINK1 bound to PRT062607 or CYC116 reveal how the compounds interact with the ATP-binding pocket. PRT062607 notably engages with the catalytic aspartate and causes a destabilization of insert-2 at the autophosphorylation dimer interface. While PRT062607 is not selective for PINK1, it provides a scaffold for the development of more selective and potent inhibitors of PINK1 that could be used as chemical probes.",

    "abstract": "During stress conditions such as heat shock and antibiotic exposure, ribosomes stall on messenger RNAs, leading to inhibition of protein synthesis. To remobilize ribosomes, bacteria use rescue factors such as HflXr, a homolog of the conserved housekeeping GTPase HflX that catalyzes the dissociation of translationally inactive ribosomes into individual subunits. Here we use time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy to elucidate the mechanism of ribosome recycling by Listeria monocytogenes HflXr. Within the 70S ribosome, HflXr displaces helix H69 of the 50S subunit and induces long-range movements of the platform domain of the 30S subunit, disrupting inter-subunit bridges B2b, B2c, B4, B7a and B7b. Our findings unveil a unique ribosome recycling strategy by HflXr which is distinct from that mediated by RRF and EF-G. The resemblance between HflXr and housekeeping HflX suggests that the alternative ribosome recycling mechanism reported here is universal in the prokaryotic kingdom.",

    "abstract": "L-Asparaginases (ASNases) catalyze the hydrolysis of L-Asn to L-Asp and ammonia. Members of the ASNase family are used as drugs in the treatment of leukemia, as well as in the food industry. The protomers of bacterial ASNases typically contain 300-400 amino acids (typical class 1 ASNases). In contrast, the chain of ASNase from Rhodospirillum rubrum, reported here and referred to as RrA, consists of only 172 amino acid residues. RrA is homologous to the N-terminal domain of typical bacterial class 1 ASNases and exhibits millimolar affinity for L-Asn. In this study, we demonstrate that RrA belongs to a unique family of cytoplasmic, short-chain ASNases (scASNases). These proteins occupy a distinct region in the sequence space, separate from the regions typically assigned to class 1 ASNases. The scASNases are present in approximately 7% of eubacterial species, spanning diverse bacterial lineages. They seem to be significantly enriched in species that encode for more than one class 1 ASNase. Here, we report biochemical, biophysical, and structural properties of RrA, a member of scASNases family. Crystal structures of the wild-type RrA, both with and without bound L-Asp, as well as structures of several RrA mutants, reveal topologically unique tetramers. Moreover, the active site of one protomer is complemented by two residues (Tyr21 and Asn26) from another protomer. Upon closer inspection, these findings clearly outline scASNases as a stand-alone subfamily of ASNases that can catalyze the hydrolysis of L-Asn to L-Asp despite the lack of the C-terminal domain that is present in all ASNases described structurally to date.",

Consequently, they also play a role in brain diseases. Therefore, understanding how these receptors can be modulated is of importance. Our study provides a crystal structure of the dimeric ligand-binding domain of the kainate receptor GluK2 in complex with L-glutamate and the small-molecule positive allosteric modulator, BPAM344, in an active-like conformation. The role of Thr535 and Gln786 in modulating GluK2 by BPAM344 was investigated using a calcium-sensitive fluorescence-based assay on transiently transfected cells expressing GluK2 and mutants hereof. This study may aid in the design of compounds targeting kainate receptors, expanding their potential as targets for the treatment of brain diseases.",

Contamination of cereals with ZEN is frequent, and hydrolytic detoxification with fungal lactonases has been explored. Here, we report the isolation of a bacterial strain, <i>Rhodococcus erythropolis</i> PFA D8-1, with ZEN hydrolyzing activity, cloning of the gene encoding \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase ZenA encoded on the linear megaplasmid pSFRL1, and biochemical characterization of nine homologues. Furthermore, we report site-directed mutagenesis as well as structural analysis of the dimeric ZenA<sub>Re</sub> of <i>R. erythropolis</i> and the more thermostable, tetrameric ZenA<sub>Scfl</sub> of <i>Streptomyces coelicoflavus</i> with and without bound ligands. The X-ray crystal structures not only revealed canonical features of \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolases with a cap domain including a Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad but also unusual features including an uncommon oxyanion hole motif and a peripheral, short antiparallel \u03b2-sheet involved in tetramer interactions. Presteady-state kinetic analyses for ZenA<sub>Re</sub> and ZenA<sub>Scfl</sub> identified balanced rate-limiting steps of the reaction cycle, which can change depending on temperature. Some new bacterial ZEN lactonases have lower <i>K</i><sub>M</sub> and higher <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> than the known fungal ZEN lactonases and may lend themselves to enzyme technology development for the degradation of ZEN in feed or food.",

    "abstract": "As SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate, antiviral treatments are needed to complement vaccines. The virus's main protease, 3CLPro, is an attractive drug target in part because it recognizes a unique cleavage site, which features a glutamine residue at the P1 position and is not utilized by human proteases. Herein, we report the invention of MK-7845, a novel reversible covalent 3CLPro inhibitor. While most covalent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLPro reported to date contain an amide as a Gln mimic at P1, MK-7845 bears a difluorobutyl substituent at this position. SAR analysis and X-ray crystallographic studies indicate that this group interacts with His163, the same residue that forms a hydrogen bond with the amide substituents typically found at P1. In addition to promising in vivo efficacy and an acceptable projected human dose with unboosted pharmacokinetics, MK-7845 exhibits favorable properties for both solubility and absorption that may be attributable to the unusual difluorobutyl substituent.",

We use time-resolved mix-and-inject serial crystallography at an x-ray free electron laser to observe catalysis in a designed mutant isocyanide hydratase (ICH) enzyme that enhances sampling of important minor conformations. The active site exists in a mixture of conformations, and formation of the thioimidate intermediate selects for catalytically competent substates. The influence of cysteine ionization on the ICH ensemble is validated by determining structures of the enzyme at multiple pH values. Large molecular dynamics simulations in crystallo and time-resolved electron density maps show that Asp<sup>17</sup> ionizes during catalysis and causes conformational changes that propagate across the dimer, permitting water to enter the active site for intermediate hydrolysis. ICH exhibits a tight coupling between ionization of active site residues and catalysis-activated protein motions, exemplifying a mechanism of electrostatic control of enzyme dynamics.",

Following our recent report on the capsid structure of A-1(L), here we present the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of its intact tail machine including the neck, tail and attached fibers. Besides the dodecameric portal, the neck contains a canonical hexamer connected to a unique pentadecamer that anchors five extended bead-chain-like neck fibers. The 1045-\u00c5-long contractile tail is composed of a helical bundle of tape measure proteins surrounded by a layer of tube proteins and a layer of sheath proteins, ended with a five-component baseplate. The six long and six short tail fibers are folded back pairwise, each with one end anchoring to the baseplate and the distal end pointing to the capsid. Structural analysis combined with biochemical assays further enable us to identify the dual hydrolytic activities of the baseplate hub, in addition to two host receptor binding domains in the tail fibers. Moreover, the structure of the intact A-1(L) also helps us to reannotate its genome. These findings will facilitate the application of A-1(L) as a chassis cyanophage in synthetic biology.",

    "abstract": "Cyanamides have emerged as privileged scaffolds in covalent inhibitors of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). However, many compounds with a cyanopyrrolidine warhead show cross-reactivity toward small subsets of DUBs or toward the protein deglycase PARK7/DJ-1, hampering their use for the selective perturbation of a single DUB in living cells. Here, we disclose N'-alkyl,N-cyanopiperazines as structures for covalent enzyme inhibition with exceptional specificity for the DUB UCHL1 among 55 human deubiquitinases and with effective target engagement in cells. Notably, transitioning from 5-membered pyrrolidines to 6-membered heterocycles eliminated PARK7 binding and introduced context-dependent reversibility of the isothiourea linkage to the catalytic cysteine of UCHL1. Compound potency and specificity were analysed by a range of biochemical assays and with a crystal structure of a cyanopiperazine in covalent complex with UCHL1. The structure revealed a compound-induced conformational restriction of the cross-over loop, which underlies the observed inhibitory potencies. Through the rationalization of specificities of different cyanamides, we introduce a framework for the investigation of protein reactivity of bioactive nitriles of this compound class. Our results represent an encouraging case study for the refining of electrophilic compounds into chemical probes, emphasizing the potential to engineer specificity through subtle chemical modifications around the warhead.",

    "abstract": "Small-molecule modulators of diverse voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> (Kv) channels may help treat a wide range of neurological disorders. However, developing effective modulators requires understanding of their mechanism of action. We apply an orthogonal approach to elucidate the mechanism of action of an imidazolidinedione derivative (AUT5), a highly selective positive allosteric modulator of Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 channels. AUT5 modulation involves positive cooperativity and preferential stabilization of the open state. The cryo-EM structure of the Kv3.1/AUT5 complex at a resolution of 2.5\u2009\u00c5 reveals four equivalent AUT5 binding sites at the extracellular inter-subunit interface between the voltage-sensing and pore domains of the channel's tetrameric assembly. Furthermore, we show that the unique extracellular turret regions of Kv3.1 and Kv3.2 essentially govern the selective positive modulation by AUT5. High-resolution apo and bound structures of Kv3.1 demonstrate how AUT5 binding promotes turret rearrangements and interactions with the voltage-sensing domain to favor the open conformation.",

TgPDCD5, a secreted protein of <i>T. gondii</i>, induces apoptosis through heparan sulfate-mediated endocytosis. The entry mechanism of TgPDCD5 has remained elusive. Here, we present the solution structure of TgPDCD5 as a helical bundle with an extended N-terminal helix, exhibiting molten globule characteristics. NMR perturbation studies reveal heparin/heparan sulfate binding involving the heparan sulfate/heparin proteoglycans-binding motif and the core region, influenced by proline isomerization of P107 residue. The heterogeneous proline recruits a cyclophilin TgCyp18, accelerating interconversion between conformers and regulating heparan/heparin binding. These atomic-level insights elucidate the binary switch's functionality, expose novel heparan sulfate-binding surfaces, and illuminate the unconventional cellular entry of pathogenic TgPDCD5.",

    "abstract": "We previously discovered first-in-class multitargeted 5-substituted pyrrolo[3,2-<i>d</i>]pyrimidine antifolates that inhibit serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2), resulting in potent in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacies. In this report, we present crystallographic structures for SHMT2 in complex with an expanded series of pyrrolo[3,2-<i>d</i>]pyrimidine compounds with variations in bridge length (3-5 carbons) and the side chain aromatic ring (phenyl, thiophene, fluorine-substituted phenyl, and thiophene). We evaluated structural features of the inhibitor-SHMT2 complexes and correlations to inhibitor potencies (i.e., <i>K</i><sub>i</sub>s), highlighting conserved polar contacts and identifying 5-carbon bridge lengths as key determinants of inhibitor potency. Based on the analysis of SHMT2 structural data, we investigated the impact of mutation of Tyr105 in SHMT2 kinetic analysis and studies with HCT116 cells with inducible expression of wild-type and Y105F SHMT2. Increased enzyme inhibition potency by the pyrrolo[3,2-<i>d</i>]pyrimidine inhibitors with Phe105 SHMT2 accompanied an increased growth inhibition of Phe105-expressing HCT116 cells compared to wild-type SHMT2. Pyrrolo[3,2-<i>d</i>]pyrimidine inhibitors with polyglutamate modifications were evaluated for potencies against SHMT2. We determined the crystal structures of SHMT2 in complex with our lead antifolate AGF347 lacking L-glutamate, or as a diglutamate and triglutamate, for comparison with parent AGF347. These data provide the first insights into the influence of antifolate polyglutamylation on SHMT2:inhibitor interactions. Collectively, our results provide new insights into the critical structural determinants of SHMT2 binding by pyrrolo[3,2-<i>d</i>]pyrimidine inhibitors as novel antitumor agents, as well as the first structural characterization of human SHMT2 in complex with polyglutamates of an SHMT2-targeted antifolate.",

    "abstract": "Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in guanosine triphosphate (GTP) synthesis and assembles into filaments in cells, which desensitizes the enzyme to feedback inhibition and boosts nucleotide production. The vertebrate retina expresses two splice variants IMPDH1(546) and IMPDH1(595). In bovine retinas, residue S477 is preferentially phosphorylated in the dark, but the effects on IMPDH1 activity and regulation are unclear. Here, we generated phosphomimetic mutants to investigate structural and functional consequences of S477 phosphorylation. The S477D mutation resensitized both variants to GTP inhibition but only blocked assembly of IMPDH1(595) filaments. Cryo-EM structures of both variants showed that S477D specifically blocks assembly of a high-activity assembly interface, still allowing assembly of low-activity IMPDH1(546) filaments. Finally, we discovered that S477D exerts a dominant-negative effect in cells, preventing endogenous IMPDH filament assembly. By modulating the structure and higher-order assembly of IMPDH, S477 phosphorylation acts as a mechanism for downregulating retinal GTP synthesis in the dark when nucleotide turnover is decreased.",

    "abstract": "Lasso peptides are a class of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) defined by a macrolactam linkage between the N-terminus and the side chain of an internal aspartic acid or glutamic acid residue. Instead of adopting a branched-cyclic conformation, lasso peptides are \"threaded\", with the C-terminal tail passing through the macrocycle to present a kinetically trapped rotaxane conformation. The availability of enhanced bioinformatics methods has led to a significant increase in the number of secondary modifications found on lasso peptides. To uncover new ancillary modifications in a targeted manner, a bioinformatic strategy was developed to discover lasso peptides with modifications to tryptophan. This effort identified numerous putative lasso peptide biosynthetic gene clusters with core regions of the precursor peptides enriched in tryptophan. Parsing of these tryptophan (Trp)-rich biosynthetic gene clusters uncovered several putative ancillary modifying enzymes, including halogenases and dimethylallyltransferases expected to act upon Trp. Characterization of two gene products yielded a lasso peptide with two 5-Cl-Trp modifications (chlorolassin) and another bearing 5-dimethylallyl-Trp and 2,3-didehydro-Tyr modifications (wygwalassin). Bioinformatic analysis of the requisite halogenase and dimethylallyltransferase revealed numerous other putative Trp-modified lasso peptides that remain uncharacterized. We anticipate that the Trp-centric strategy reported herein may be useful in discovering ancillary modifications for other RiPP classes and, more generally, guide the functional prediction of enzymes that act on specific amino acids.",

    "abstract": "Clamp loaders are pentameric ATPases that place circular sliding clamps onto DNA, where they function in DNA replication and genome integrity. The central activity of a clamp loader is the opening of the ring-shaped sliding clamp and the subsequent binding to primer-template (p/t)-junctions. The general architecture of clamp loaders is conserved across all life, suggesting that their mechanism is retained. Recent structural studies of the eukaryotic clamp loader replication factor C (RFC) revealed that it functions using a crab-claw mechanism, where clamp opening is coupled to a massive conformational change in the loader. Here we investigate the clamp loading mechanism of the Escherichia coli clamp loader at high resolution using cryo-electron microscopy. We find that the E.\u00a0coli clamp loader opens the clamp using a crab-claw motion at a single pivot point, whereas the eukaryotic RFC loader uses motions distributed across the complex. Furthermore, we find clamp opening occurs in multiple steps, starting with a partly open state with a spiral conformation, and proceeding to a wide open clamp in a surprising planar geometry. Finally, our structures in the presence of p/t-junctions illustrate how the clamp closes around p/t-junctions and how the clamp loader initiates release from the loaded clamp. Our results reveal mechanistic distinctions in a macromolecular machine that is conserved across all domains of life.",

    "abstract": "The poison dart toxin batrachotoxin is exceptional for its high potency and toxicity, and for its multifaceted modification of the function of voltage-gated sodium channels. By using cryogenic electron microscopy, we identify two homologous, but nonidentical receptor sites that simultaneously bind two molecules of toxin, one at the interface between Domains I and IV, and the other at the interface between Domains III and IV of the cardiac sodium channel. Together, these two bound toxin molecules stabilize \u03b1/\u03c0 helical conformation in the S6 segments that gate the pore, and one of the bound BTX-B molecules interacts with the crucial Lys1421 residue that is essential for sodium conductance and selectivity via an apparent water-bridged hydrogen bond. Overall, our structure provides insight into batrachotoxin's potency, efficacy, and multifaceted functional effects on voltage-gated sodium channels via a dual receptor site mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitors of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) such as nirmatrelvir (NTV) and ensitrelvir (ETV) have proven effective in reducing the severity of COVID-19, but the presence of resistance-conferring mutations in sequenced viral genomes raises concerns about future drug resistance. Second-generation oral drugs that retain function against these mutants are thus urgently needed. We hypothesized that the covalent hepatitis C virus protease inhibitor boceprevir (BPV) could serve as the basis for orally bioavailable drugs that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> more efficiently than existing drugs. Performing structure-guided modifications of BPV, we developed a picomolar-affinity inhibitor, ML2006a4, with antiviral activity, oral pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic efficacy similar or superior to those of NTV. A crucial feature of ML2006a4 is a derivatization of the ketoamide reactive group that improves cell permeability and oral bioavailability. Last, ML2006a4 was found to be less sensitive to several mutations that cause resistance to NTV or ETV and occur in the natural SARS-CoV-2 population. Thus, anticipatory design can preemptively address potential resistance mechanisms to expand future treatment options against coronavirus variants.",

    "abstract": "The homeostatic regulation of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) activity in yeast involves N-terminal phosphorylation of Orm proteins, while higher eukaryotes lack these phosphorylation sites. Although recent studies have indicated a conserved ceramide-mediated feedback inhibition of the SPT-ORM/ORMDL complex in higher eukaryotes, its conservation and relationship with phosphorylation regulation in yeast remain unclear. Here, we determine the structure of the yeast SPT-Orm2 complex in a dephosphomimetic state and identify an evolutionarily conserved ceramide-sensing site. Ceramide stabilizes the dephosphomimetic Orm2 in an inhibitory conformation, facilitated by an intramolecular \u03b2-sheet between the N- and C-terminal segments of Orm2. Moreover, we find that a phosphomimetic mutant of Orm2, positioned adjacent to its intramolecular \u03b2-sheet, destabilizes the inhibitory conformation of Orm2. Taken together, our findings suggest that both Orm dephosphorylation and ceramide binding are crucial for suppressing SPT activity in yeast. This highlights a distinctive regulatory mechanism in yeast involving the collaborative actions of phosphorylation and ceramide.",

    "abstract": "Modulation of protein function through allosteric regulation is central in biology, but biomacromolecular systems involving multiple subunits and ligands may exhibit complex regulatory mechanisms at different levels, which remain poorly understood. Here, we discover an aldo-keto reductase termed AKRtyl and present its three-level regulatory mechanism. Specifically, by combining steady-state and transient kinetics, X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics simulation, we demonstrate that AKRtyl exhibits a positive synergy mediated by an unusual Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) paradigm of allosteric regulation at low concentrations of the cofactor NADPH, but an inhibitory effect at high concentrations is observed. While the substrate tylosin binds at a remote allosteric site with positive cooperativity. We further reveal that these regulatory mechanisms are conserved in AKR12D subfamily, and that substrate cooperativity is common in AKRs across three kingdoms of life. This work provides an intriguing example for understanding complex allosteric regulatory networks.",

    "abstract": "Directed evolution of computationally designed enzymes has provided new insights into the emergence of sophisticated catalytic sites in proteins. In this regard, we have recently shown that a histidine nucleophile and a flexible arginine can work in synergy to accelerate the Morita-Baylis-Hillman (MBH) reaction with unrivalled efficiency. Here, we show that replacing the catalytic histidine with a non-canonical N<sub>\u03b4</sub>-methylhistidine (MeHis23) nucleophile leads to a substantially altered evolutionary outcome in which the catalytic Arg124 has been abandoned. Instead, Glu26 has emerged, which mediates a rate-limiting proton transfer step to deliver an enzyme (BH<sub>MeHis</sub>1.8) that is more than an order of magnitude more active than our earlier MBHase. Interestingly, although MeHis23 to His substitution in BH<sub>MeHis</sub>1.8 reduces activity by 4-fold, the resulting His containing variant is still a potent MBH biocatalyst. However, analysis of the BH<sub>MeHis</sub>1.8 evolutionary trajectory reveals that the MeHis nucleophile was crucial in the early stages of engineering to unlock the new mechanistic pathway. This study demonstrates how even subtle perturbations to key catalytic elements of designed enzymes can lead to vastly different evolutionary outcomes, resulting in new mechanistic solutions to complex chemical transformations.",

    "abstract": "The Hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2), also known as the niacin receptor or GPR109A, is a prototypical GPCR that plays a central role in the inhibition of lipolytic and atherogenic activities. Its activation also results in vasodilation that is linked to the side-effect of flushing associated with dyslipidemia drugs such as niacin. GPR109A continues to be a target for developing potential therapeutics in dyslipidemia with minimized flushing response. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of the GPR109A in complex with dyslipidemia drugs, niacin or acipimox, non-flushing agonists, MK6892 or GSK256073, and recently approved psoriasis drug, monomethyl fumarate (MMF). These structures elucidate the binding mechanism of agonists, molecular basis of receptor activation, and insights into biased signaling elicited by some of the agonists. The structural framework also allows us to engineer receptor mutants that exhibit G-protein signaling bias, and therefore, our study may help in structure-guided drug discovery efforts targeting this receptor.",

Here, we establish that the human concentrative nucleoside transporter 3 (CNT3) interacts with antiviral drugs used in the treatment of coronavirus infections. We report high-resolution single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structures of bovine CNT3 complexed with antiviral nucleosides N<sup>4</sup>-hydroxycytidine, PSI-6206, GS-441524 and ribavirin, all in inward-facing states. Notably, we found that the orally bioavailable antiviral molnupiravir arrests CNT3 in four distinct conformations, allowing us to capture cryo-electron microscopy structures of drug-loaded outward-facing and drug-loaded intermediate states. Our studies uncover the conformational trajectory of CNT3 during membrane transport of a nucleoside analog antiviral drug, yield new insights into the role of interactions between the transport and the scaffold domains in elevator-like domain movements during drug translocation, and provide insights into the design of nucleoside analog antiviral prodrugs with improved oral bioavailability.",

    "abstract": "The theories for substrate recognition in enzyme catalysis have evolved from lock-key to induced fit, then conformational selection, and conformational selection followed by induced fit. However, the prevalence and consensus of these theories require further examination. Here we use cryogenic electron microscopy and African swine fever virus type 2 topoisomerase (AsfvTop2) to demonstrate substrate binding theories in a joint and ordered manner: catalytic selection by the enzyme, conformational selection by the substrates, then induced fit. The apo-AsfvTop2 pre-exists in six conformers that comply with the two-gate mechanism directing DNA passage and release in the Top2 catalytic cycle. The structures of AsfvTop2-DNA-inhibitor complexes show that substantial induced-fit changes occur locally from the closed apo-conformer that however is too far-fetched for the open apo-conformer. Furthermore, the ATPase domain of AsfvTop2 in the MgAMP-PNP-bound crystal structures coexist in reduced and oxidized forms involving a disulfide bond, which can regulate the AsfvTop2 function.",

    "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease with a clear genetic component. While most SLE patients carry rare gene variants in lupus risk genes, little is known about their contribution to disease pathogenesis. Amongst them, SH2B3-a negative regulator of cytokine and growth factor receptor signaling-harbors rare coding variants in over 5% of SLE patients. Here, we show that unlike the variant found exclusively in healthy controls, SH2B3 rare variants found in lupus patients are predominantly hypomorphic alleles, failing to suppress IFNGR signaling via JAK2-STAT1. The generation of two mouse lines carrying patients' variants revealed that SH2B3 is important in limiting the number of immature and transitional B cells. Furthermore, hypomorphic SH2B3 was shown to impair the negative selection of immature/transitional self-reactive B cells and accelerate autoimmunity in sensitized mice, at least in part due to increased IL-4R signaling and BAFF-R expression. This work identifies a previously unappreciated role for SH2B3 in human B cell tolerance and lupus risk.",

Although their gating mechanism has been studied extensively, understanding how cations traverse the pore has remained elusive. Here we investigated putative ion and water densities in the open pore of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPARs (rat GRIA2 flip-Q isoform) at 2.3-2.6\u2009\u00c5 resolution. We show that the ion permeation pathway attains an extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site (site-G) when the channel gate moves into the open configuration. Site-G is highly selective for Ca<sup>2+</sup> over Na<sup>+</sup>, favoring the movement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the selectivity filter of the pore. Seizure-related N619K mutation, adjacent to site-G, promotes channel opening but attenuates Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and thus diminishes Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability. Our work identifies the importance of site-G, which coordinates with the Q/R site of the selectivity filter to ensure the preferential transport of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through the channel pore.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB), a leading cause of mortality globally, is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis that primarily infiltrates the lung. The mature crRNAs in M. tuberculosis transcribed from the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) locus exhibit an atypical structure featured with 5' and 3' repeat tags at both ends of the intact crRNA, in contrast to typical Type-III-A crRNAs that possess 5' repeat tags and partial crRNA sequences. However, this structural peculiarity particularly concerning the specific binding characteristics of the 3' repeat end within the mature crRNA within the Csm complex, has not been comprehensively elucidated. Here, our Mycobacteria CRISPR-Csm complexes structure represents the largest Csm complex reported to date. It incorporates an atypical Type-III-A CRISPR RNA (crRNA) (46\u00a0nt) with 5' 8-nt and 3' 4-nt repeat sequences in the stoichiometry of Mycobacteria Csm1<sub>1</sub>2<sub>5</sub>3<sub>6</sub>4<sub>1</sub>5<sub>1.</sub> The PAM-independent single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) are the most suitable substrate for the Csm complex. The 3'-repeat end trimming of mature crRNA was not necessary for its cleavage activity in Type-III-A Csm complex.

    "abstract": "Enzymes catalyze biochemical reactions through precise positioning of substrates, cofactors, and amino acids to modulate the transition-state free energy. However, the role of conformational dynamics remains poorly understood due to poor experimental access. This shortcoming is evident with <i>Escherichia coli</i> dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a model system for the role of protein dynamics in catalysis, for which it is unknown how the enzyme regulates the different active site environments required to facilitate proton and hydride transfer. Here, we describe ligand-, temperature-, and electric-field-based perturbations during X-ray diffraction experiments to map the conformational dynamics of the Michaelis complex of DHFR. We resolve coupled global and local motions and find that these motions are engaged by the protonated substrate to promote efficient catalysis. This result suggests a fundamental design principle for multistep enzymes in which pre-existing dynamics enable intermediates to drive rapid electrostatic reorganization to facilitate subsequent chemical steps.",

    "abstract": "Prokaryotic type III CRISPR-Cas systems provide immunity against viruses and plasmids using CRISPR-associated Rossman fold (CARF) protein effectors<sup>1-5</sup>. Recognition of transcripts of these invaders with sequences that are complementary to CRISPR RNA guides leads to the production of cyclic oligoadenylate second messengers, which bind CARF domains and trigger the activity of an effector domain<sup>6,7</sup>. Whereas most effectors degrade host and invader nucleic acids, some are predicted to contain transmembrane helices without an enzymatic function. Whether and how these CARF-transmembrane helix fusion proteins facilitate the type III CRISPR-Cas immune response remains unknown. Here we investigate the role of cyclic oligoadenylate-activated membrane protein 1 (Cam1) during type III CRISPR immunity. Structural and biochemical analyses reveal that the CARF domains of a Cam1 dimer bind cyclic tetra-adenylate second messengers. In vivo, Cam1 localizes to the membrane, is predicted to form a tetrameric transmembrane pore, and provides defence against viral infection through the induction of membrane depolarization and growth arrest. These results reveal that CRISPR immunity does not always operate through the degradation of nucleic acids, but is instead mediated via a wider range of cellular responses.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac muscle contraction occurs due to repetitive interactions between myosin thick and actin thin filaments (TF) regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, active cross-bridges, and cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C). The cardiac TF (cTF) has two nonequivalent strands, each comprised of actin, tropomyosin (Tm), and troponin (Tn). Tn shifts Tm away from myosin-binding sites on actin at elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels to allow formation of force-producing actomyosin cross-bridges. The Tn complex is comprised of three distinct polypeptides - Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding TnC, inhibitory TnI, and Tm-binding TnT. The molecular mechanism of their collective action is unresolved due to lack of comprehensive structural information on Tn region of cTF. C1 domain of cMyBP-C activates cTF in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the same extent as rigor myosin. Here we used cryo-EM of native cTFs to show that cTF Tn core adopts multiple structural conformations at high and low Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and that the two strands are structurally distinct. At high Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, cTF is not entirely activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> but exists in either partially or fully activated state. Complete dissociation of TnI C-terminus is required for full activation. In presence of cMyBP-C C1 domain, Tn core adopts a fully activated conformation, even in absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Our data provide a structural description for the requirement of myosin to fully activate cTFs and explain increased affinity of TnC to Ca<sup>2+</sup> in presence of active cross-bridges. We suggest that allosteric coupling between Tn subunits and Tm is required to control actomyosin interactions.",

Using a chemical biology approach with both synthetised and established ligands, combining synthesis, crystallography, computational docking, HPLC and fluorescence polarization binding assays using fluorescently-tagged InsP<sub>3</sub>, we have surveyed the limits of InsP<sub>3</sub> 3-kinase ligand specificity and uncovered surprisingly unforeseen biosynthetic capacity. Structurally-modified ligands exploit active site plasticity generating a helix-tilt. These facilitated uncovering of unexpected substrates phosphorylated at a surrogate extended primary hydroxyl at the inositol pseudo 3-position, applicable even to carbohydrate-based substrates. Crystallization experiments designed to allow reactions to proceed in situ facilitated unequivocal characterization of the atypical tetrakisphosphate products. In summary, we define features of InsP<sub>3</sub> 3-kinase plasticity and substrate tolerance that may be more widely exploitable.",

Here, we showed that UNC-5 is a heparin-binding protein, determined its structure bound to a heparin fragment, and could modulate UNC-5-heparin affinity using a directed evolution platform or structure-based rational design. We demonstrated that UNC-5 and UNC-6/netrin form a large, stable, and rigid complex in the presence of heparin, and heparin and UNC-5 exclude the attractive UNC-40/DCC receptor from binding to UNC-6/netrin to a large extent. <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> with a heparin-binding-deficient UNC-5 fail to establish proper gonad morphology due to abrogated cell migration, which relies on repulsive UNC-5 signaling in response to UNC-6. Combining UNC-5 mutations targeting heparin and UNC-6/netrin contacts results in complete cell migration and axon guidance defects. Our findings establish repulsive netrin responses to be mediated through a glycosaminoglycan-regulated macromolecular complex.",

    "abstract": "The subcortical maternal complex (SCMC) plays a crucial role in early embryonic development. Malfunction of SCMC leads to reproductive diseases in women. However, the molecular function and assembly basis for SCMC remain elusive. Here we reconstituted mouse SCMC and solved the structure at atomic resolution using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The core complex of SCMC was formed by MATER, TLE6 and FLOPED, and MATER embraced TLE6 and FLOPED via its NACHT and LRR domains. Two core complexes further dimerize through interactions between two LRR domains of MATERs in vitro. FILIA integrates into SCMC by interacting with the carboxyl-terminal region of FLOPED. Zygotes from mice with Floped C-terminus truncation showed delayed development and resembled the phenotype of zygotes from Filia knockout mice. More importantly, the assembly of mouse SCMC was affected by corresponding clinical variants associated with female reproductive diseases and corresponded with a prediction based on the mouse SCMC structure. Our study paves the way for further investigations on SCMC functions during mammalian preimplantation embryonic development and reveals underlying causes of female reproductive diseases related to SCMC mutations, providing a new strategy for the diagnosis of female reproductive disorders.",

    "abstract": "High-intensity femtosecond pulses from an X-ray free-electron laser enable pump-probe experiments for the investigation of electronic and nuclear changes during light-induced reactions. On timescales ranging from femtoseconds to milliseconds and for a variety of biological systems, time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography (TR-SFX) has provided detailed structural data for light-induced isomerization, breakage or formation of chemical bonds and electron transfer<sup>1,2</sup>. However, all ultrafast TR-SFX studies to date have employed such high pump laser energies that nominally several photons were absorbed per chromophore<sup>3-17</sup>. As multiphoton absorption may force the protein response into non-physiological pathways, it is of great concern<sup>18,19</sup> whether this experimental approach<sup>20</sup> allows valid conclusions to be drawn vis-\u00e0-vis biologically relevant single-photon-induced reactions<sup>18,19</sup>. Here we describe ultrafast pump-probe SFX experiments on the photodissociation of carboxymyoglobin, showing that different pump laser fluences yield markedly different results. In particular, the dynamics of structural changes and observed indicators of the mechanistically important coherent oscillations of the Fe-CO bond distance (predicted by recent quantum wavepacket dynamics<sup>21</sup>) are seen to depend strongly on pump laser energy, in line with quantum chemical analysis. Our results confirm both the feasibility and necessity of performing ultrafast TR-SFX pump-probe experiments in the linear photoexcitation regime. We consider this to be a starting point for reassessing both the design and the\u00a0interpretation of ultrafast TR-SFX pump-probe experiments<sup>20</sup> such that mechanistically relevant insight emerges.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria and evolutionarily related chloroplasts of algae and plants possess unique RNA polymerases (RNAPs) with characteristics that distinguish them from canonical bacterial RNAPs. The largest subunit of cyanobacterial RNAP (cyRNAP) is divided into two polypeptides, \u03b2'1 and \u03b2'2, and contains the largest known lineage-specific insertion domain, Si3, located in the middle of the trigger loop and spanning approximately half of the \u03b2'2 subunit. In this study, we present the X-ray crystal structure of Si3 and the cryo-EM structures of the cyRNAP transcription elongation complex plus the NusG factor with and without incoming nucleoside triphosphate (iNTP) bound at the active site. Si3 has a well-ordered and elongated shape that exceeds the length of the main body of cyRNAP, fits into cavities of cyRNAP in the absence of iNTP bound at the active site and shields the binding site of secondary channel-binding proteins such as Gre and DksA. A small transition from the trigger loop to the trigger helix upon iNTP binding results in a large swing motion of Si3; however, this transition does not affect the catalytic activity of cyRNAP due to its minimal contact with cyRNAP, NusG, or DNA. This study provides a structural framework for understanding the evolutionary significance of these features unique to cyRNAP and chloroplast RNAP and may provide insights into the molecular mechanism of transcription in specific environment of photosynthetic organisms and organelle.",

    "abstract": "Membrane adenylyl cyclase AC8 is regulated by G proteins and calmodulin (CaM), mediating the crosstalk between the cAMP pathway and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling. Despite the importance of AC8 in physiology, the structural basis of its regulation by G proteins and CaM is not well defined. Here, we report the 3.5 \u00c5 resolution cryo-EM structure of the bovine AC8 bound to the stimulatory G\u03b1s protein in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM. The structure reveals the architecture of the ordered AC8 domains bound to G\u03b1s and the small molecule activator forskolin. The extracellular surface of AC8 features a negatively charged pocket, a potential site for unknown interactors. Despite the well-resolved forskolin density, the captured state of AC8 does not favour tight nucleotide binding. The\u00a0structural proteomics approaches, limited proteolysis and crosslinking mass spectrometry\u00a0(LiP-MS and XL-MS), allowed us to identify the contact sites between AC8 and its regulators, CaM, G\u03b1s, and G\u03b2\u03b3, as well as to infer the conformational changes induced by these interactions. Our results provide a framework for understanding the role of flexible regions in the mechanism of AC regulation.",

    "abstract": "Plants genetically modified by the pathogenic Agrobacterium strain C58 synthesize agrocinopines A and B, whereas those modified by the pathogenic strain Bo542 produce agrocinopines C and D. The four agrocinopines (A, B, C and D) serve as nutrients by agrobacteria and signaling molecule for the dissemination of virulence genes. They share the uncommon pyranose-2-phosphate motif, represented by the l-arabinopyranose moiety in agrocinopines A/B and the d-glucopyranose moiety in agrocinopines C/D, also found in the antibiotic agrocin 84. They are imported into agrobacterial cytoplasm via the Acc transport system, including the solute-binding protein AccA coupled to an ABC transporter. We have previously shown that unexpectedly, AccA from strain C58 (AccAC58) recognizes the pyranose-2-phosphate motif present in all four agrocinopines and agrocin 84, meaning that strain C58 is able to import agrocinopines C/D, originating from the competitor strain Bo542. Here, using agrocinopine derivatives and combining crystallography, affinity and stability measurements, modeling, molecular dynamics, in vitro and vivo assays, we show that AccABo542 and AccAC58 behave differently despite 75% sequence identity and a nearly identical ligand binding site. Indeed, strain Bo542 imports only compounds containing the d-glucopyranose-2-phosphate moiety, and with a lower affinity compared with strain C58. This difference in import efficiency makes C58 more competitive than Bo542 in culture media. We can now explain why Agrobacterium/Allorhizobium vitis strain S4 is insensitive to agrocin 84, although its genome contains a conserved Acc transport system. Overall, our work highlights AccA proteins as a case study, for which stability and dynamics drive specificity.",

    "abstract": "The EU-OPENSCREEN (EU-OS) European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) is a multinational, not-for-profit initiative that integrates high-capacity screening platforms and chemistry groups across Europe to facilitate research in chemical biology and early drug discovery. Over the years, the EU-OS has assembled a high-throughput screening compound collection, the European Chemical Biology Library (ECBL), that contains approximately 100\u2009000 commercially available small molecules and a growing number of thousands of academic compounds crowdsourced through our network of European and non-European chemists. As an extension of the ECBL, here we describe the computational design, quality control and use case screenings of the European Fragment Screening Library (EFSL) composed of 1056 mini and small chemical fragments selected from a substructure analysis of the ECBL. Access to the EFSL is open to researchers from both academia and industry. Using EFSL, eight fragment screening campaigns using different structural and biophysical methods have successfully identified fragment hits in the last two years. As one of the highlighted projects for antibiotics, we describe the screening by Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) of the EFSL, the identification of a 35 \u03bcM fragment hit targeting the beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase 2 (FabF), its binding confirmation to the protein by X-ray crystallography (PDB 8PJ0), its subsequent rapid exploration of its surrounding chemical space through hit-picking of ECBL compounds that contain the fragment hit as a core substructure, and the final binding confirmation of two follow-up hits by X-ray crystallography (PDB 8R0I and 8R1V).",

    "abstract": "VANGL2 is a core component of the non-canonical Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity signaling pathway that uses its highly conserved carboxy-terminal type 1 PDZ-binding motif (PBM) to bind a variety of PDZ proteins. In this study, we characterize and quantitatively assess the largest VANGL2 PDZome-binding profile documented so far, using orthogonal methods. The results of our holdup approach support VANGL2 interactions with a large panel of both long-recognized and unprecedented PDZ domains. Truncation and point mutation analyses of the VANGL2 PBM establish that, beyond the strict requirement of the P-0 / V521 and P-2 / T519 amino acids, upstream residues, including E518, Q516 and R514 at, respectively, P-3, P-5 and P-7 further contribute to the robustness of VANGL2 interactions with two distinct PDZ domains, SNX27 and SCRIBBLE-PDZ3. In agreement with these data, incremental amino-terminal deletions of the VANGL2 PBM causes its overall affinity to progressively decline. Moreover, the holdup data establish that the PDZome binding repertoire of VANGL2 starts to diverge significantly with the truncation of E518. A structural analysis of the SYNJ2BP-PDZ/VANGL2 interaction with truncated PBMs identifies a major conformational change in the binding direction of the PBM peptide after the P-2 position. Finally, we report that the PDZome binding profile of VANGL2 is dramatically rearranged upon phosphorylation of S517, T519 and S520. Our crystallographic approach illustrates how SYNJ2BP accommodates a S520-phosphorylated PBM peptide through the ideal positioning of two basic residues, K48 and R86. Altogether our data provides a comprehensive view of the VANGL2 PDZ network and how this network specifically responds to the post-translation modification of distinct PBM residues. These findings should prove useful in guiding future functional and molecular studies of the key PCP component VANGL2.",

    "abstract": "Transcription initiation is a complex process, and its mechanism is incompletely understood. We determined the structures of de novo transcribing complexes TC2 to TC17 with RNA polymerase II halted on G-less promoters when nascent RNAs reach 2 to 17 nucleotides in length, respectively. Connecting these structures generated a movie and a working model. As initially synthesized RNA grows, general transcription factors (GTFs) remain bound to the promoter and the transcription bubble expands. Nucleoside triphosphate (NTP)-driven RNA-DNA translocation and template-strand accumulation in a nearly sealed channel may promote the transition from initially transcribing complexes (ITCs) (TC2 to TC9) to early elongation complexes (EECs) (TC10 to TC17). Our study shows dynamic processes of transcription initiation and reveals why ITCs require GTFs and bubble expansion for initial RNA synthesis, whereas EECs need GTF dissociation from the promoter and bubble collapse for promoter escape.",

    "abstract": "SHIP1, an inositol 5-phosphatase, plays a central role in cellular signaling. As such, it has been implicated in many conditions. Exploiting SHIP1 as a drug target will require structural knowledge and the design of selective small molecules. We have determined apo, and magnesium and phosphate-bound structures of the\u00a0phosphatase and C2 domains of SHIP1. The C2 domains of SHIP1 and the related SHIP2 modulate the\u00a0activity of the phosphatase domain. To understand the mechanism, we performed activity assays, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, and molecular dynamics on SHIP1 and SHIP2. Our findings demonstrate that the influence of the C2 domain is more pronounced for SHIP2 than SHIP1. We determined 91 structures of SHIP1 with fragments bound, with some near the interface between the two domains. We performed a mass spectrometry screen and determined four structures with covalent fragments. These structures could act as starting points for the development of potent, selective probes.",

Evaluation against human carbonic anhydrase isoforms (hCA I, II, IX, XII) revealed potent inhibition. The widely expressed cytosolic hCA I was inhibited across a range of concentrations (<i>K</i><sub><i>I</i></sub> 3.9-870.9 nM). hCA II, also cytosolic, exhibited good inhibition as well. Notably, all compounds effectively inhibited tumor-associated hCA IX (<i>K</i><sub><i>I</i></sub> 1.9-211.2 nM) and hCA XII (low nanomolar). Biological assessments on MCF7 cancer cells highlighted the compounds' ability, in conjunction with doxorubicin, to significantly impact tumor cell viability.

    "abstract": "Nucleocytoplasmic transport regulates the passage of proteins between the nucleus and cytoplasm. In the best characterized pathway, importin (IMP) \u03b1 bridges cargoes bearing basic, classical nuclear localization signals (cNLSs) to IMP\u03b21, which mediates transport through the nuclear pore complex. IMP\u03b1 recognizes three types of cNLSs via two binding sites: the major binding site accommodates monopartite cNLSs, the minor binding site recognizes atypical cNLSs, while bipartite cNLSs simultaneously interact with both major and minor sites. Despite the growing knowledge regarding IMP\u03b1-cNLS interactions, our understanding of the evolution of cNLSs is limited. We combined bioinformatic, biochemical, functional, and structural approaches to study this phenomenon, using polyomaviruses (PyVs) large tumor antigens (LTAs) as a model. We characterized functional cNLSs from all human (H)PyV LTAs, located between the LXCXE motif and origin binding domain. Surprisingly, the prototypical SV40 monopartite NLS is not well conserved; HPyV LTA NLSs are extremely heterogenous in terms of structural organization, IMP\u03b1 isoform binding, and nuclear targeting abilities, thus influencing the nuclear accumulation properties of full-length proteins. While several LTAs possess bipartite cNLSs, merkel cell PyV contains a hybrid bipartite cNLS whose upstream stretch of basic amino acids can function as an atypical cNLS, specifically binding to the IMP\u03b1 minor site upon deletion of the downstream amino acids after viral integration in the host genome. Therefore, duplication of a monopartite cNLS and subsequent accumulation of point mutations, optimizing interaction with distinct IMP\u03b1 binding sites, led to the evolution of bipartite and atypical NLSs binding at the minor site.",

    "abstract": "Several essential cellular metabolites, such as enzyme cofactors, contain sulfur atoms and their biosynthesis requires specific thiolation enzymes. LarE is an ATP-dependent sulfur insertase, which catalyzes the sequential conversion of the two carboxylate groups of the precursor of the lactate racemase cofactor into thiocarboxylates. Two types of LarE enzymes are known, one that uses a catalytic cysteine as a sacrificial sulfur donor, and the other one that uses a [4Fe-4S] cluster as a cofactor. Only the crystal structure of LarE from Lactobacillus plantarum (LpLarE) from the first class has been solved. We report here the crystal structure of LarE from Methanococcus maripaludis (MmLarE), belonging to the second class, in the cluster-free (apo-) and cluster-bound (holo-) forms. The structure of holo-MmLarE shows that the [4Fe-4S] cluster is chelated by three cysteines only, leaving an open coordination site on one Fe atom. Moreover, the fourth nonprotein-bonded iron atom was able to bind an anionic ligand such as a phosphate group or a chloride ion. Together with the spectroscopic analysis of holo-MmLarE and the previously reported biochemical investigations of holo-LarE from Thermotoga maritima, these crystal structures support the hypothesis of a reaction mechanism, in which the [4Fe-4S] cluster binds a hydrogenosulfide ligand in place of the chloride anion, thus generating a [4Fe-5S] intermediate, and transfers it to the substrate, as in the case of [4Fe-4S]-dependent tRNA thiolation enzymes.",

Structural changes of the metal cluster and its environment during the S-state transitions have been studied on the microsecond timescale. Here we use pump-probe serial femtosecond crystallography to reveal the structural dynamics of PSII from nanoseconds to milliseconds after illumination with one\u00a0flash (1F) or two flashes (2F). Y<sub>Z</sub>, a tyrosine residue that connects the reaction centre P680 and the Mn<sub>4</sub>CaO<sub>5</sub> cluster, showed structural changes on a nanosecond timescale, as did its surrounding amino acid residues and water molecules, reflecting the fast transfer of electrons and protons after flash illumination. Notably, one water molecule emerged in the vicinity of Glu189 of the D1 subunit of PSII (D1-E189), and was bound to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion on a sub-microsecond timescale after 2F illumination. This water molecule disappeared later with the concomitant increase of O6, suggesting that it is the origin of O6. We also observed concerted movements of water molecules in the O1, O4 and Cl-1 channels and their surrounding amino acid residues to complete the sequence of electron transfer, proton release and substrate water delivery. These results provide crucial insights into the structural dynamics of PSII during S-state transitions as well as O-O bond formation.",

Herein, we describe the potent cystargolides as the first natural \u03b2-lactone inhibitors of the proteolytic core ClpP. Based on the discovery of two clpP genes next to the cystargolide biosynthetic gene cluster in Kitasatospora cystarginea, we explored ClpP as a potential cystargolide target. We show the inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus ClpP by cystargolide A and B by different biochemical methods in vitro. Synthesis of semisynthetic derivatives and probes with improved cell penetration allowed us to confirm ClpP as a specific target in S. aureus cells and to demonstrate the anti-virulence activity of this natural product class. Crystal structures show cystargolide A covalently bound to all 14 active sites of ClpP from S. aureus, Aquifex aeolicus, and Photorhabdus laumondii, and reveal the molecular mechanism of ClpP inhibition by \u03b2-lactones, the predominant class of ClpP inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Artificially Expanded Genetic Information Systems (AEGIS) add independently replicable unnatural nucleotide pairs to the natural G:C and A:T/U pairs found in native DNA, joining the unnatural pairs through alternative modes of hydrogen bonding. Whether and how AEGIS pairs are recognized and processed by multi-subunit cellular RNA polymerases (RNAPs) remains unknown. Here, we show that E. coli RNAP selectively recognizes unnatural nucleobases in a six-letter expanded genetic system. High-resolution cryo-EM structures of three RNAP elongation complexes containing template-substrate UBPs reveal the shared principles behind the recognition of AEGIS and natural base pairs. In these structures, RNAPs are captured in an active state, poised to perform the chemistry step. At this point, the unnatural base pair adopts a Watson-Crick geometry, and the trigger loop is folded into an active conformation, indicating that the mechanistic principles underlying recognition and incorporation of natural base pairs also apply to AEGIS unnatural base pairs. These data validate the design philosophy of AEGIS unnatural basepairs. Further, we provide structural evidence supporting a long-standing hypothesis that pair mismatch during transcription occurs via tautomerization. Together, our work highlights the importance of Watson-Crick complementarity underlying the design principles of AEGIS base pair recognition.",

The nucleoprotein (N) binds the RNA using its globular core and polymerizes through the N-terminus, which is presented as a highly flexible arm, as demonstrated in this article. The nucleoprotein exists in an `open' or a `closed' conformation. In the case of the closed conformation the flexible N-terminal arm folds over the RNA-binding cleft, preventing RNA adsorption. In the open conformation the arm is extended in such a way that both RNA adsorption and N polymerization are possible. In this article, single-crystal X-ray diffraction and small-angle X-ray scattering were used to study the N protein of Toscana virus complexed with a single-chain camelid antibody (VHH) and it is shown that in the presence of the antibody the nucleoprotein is unable to achieve a functional assembly to form a ribonucleoprotein complex.",

In archaea, S-layers usually form the only structural component of the cell wall and thus act as the final frontier between the cell and its environment. Therefore, S-layers are crucial for supporting microbial life. Notwithstanding their importance, little is known about archaeal S-layers at the atomic level.

The outer component of this S-layer (SlaA) is a flexible, highly glycosylated, and stable protein. Together with the inner and membrane-bound component (SlaB), they assemble into a porous and interwoven lattice. We hypothesise that jackknife-like conformational changes in SlaA play important roles in S-layer assembly.",

In this work, we determined the structural mechanism of the photolyase-catalyzed repair of a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) lesion using time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography (TR-SFX). We obtained 18 snapshots that show time-dependent changes in four reaction loci. We used these results to create a movie that depicts the repair of CPD lesions in the picosecond-to-nanosecond range, followed by the recovery of the enzymatic moieties involved in catalysis, completing the formation of the fully reduced enzyme-product complex at 500 nanoseconds. Finally, back-flip intermediates of the thymine bases to reanneal the DNA were captured at 25 to 200 microseconds. Our data cover the complete molecular mechanism of a photolyase and, importantly, its chemistry and enzymatic catalysis at work across a wide timescale and at atomic resolution.",

    "abstract": "Photolyase is an enzyme that uses light to catalyze DNA repair. To capture the reaction intermediates involved in the enzyme's catalytic cycle, we conducted a time-resolved crystallography experiment. We found that photolyase traps the excited state of the active cofactor, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), in a highly bent geometry. This excited state performs electron transfer to damaged DNA, inducing repair. We show that the repair reaction, which involves the lysis of two covalent bonds, occurs through a single-bond intermediate. The transformation of the substrate into product crowds the active site and disrupts hydrogen bonds with the enzyme, resulting in stepwise product release, with the 3' thymine ejected first, followed by the 5' base.",

    "abstract": "Kinases that synthesize inositol phosphates (IPs) and pyrophosphates (PP-IPs) control numerous biological processes in eukaryotic cells. Herein, we extend this cellular signaling repertoire to viruses. We have biochemically and structurally characterized a minimalist inositol phosphate kinase (i.e., TvIPK) encoded by Terrestrivirus, a nucleocytoplasmic large (\"giant\") DNA virus (NCLDV). We show that TvIPK can synthesize inositol pyrophosphates from a range of scyllo- and myo-IPs, both in vitro and when expressed in yeast cells. We present multiple crystal structures of enzyme/substrate/nucleotide complexes with individual resolutions from 1.95 to 2.6\u2009\u00c5. We find a heart-shaped ligand binding pocket comprising an array of positively charged and flexible side chains, underlying the observed substrate diversity. A crucial arginine residue in a conserved \"G-loop\" orients the \u03b3-phosphate of ATP to allow substrate pyrophosphorylation. We highlight additional conserved catalytic and architectural features in TvIPK, and support their importance through site-directed mutagenesis. We propose that NCLDV inositol phosphate kinases may have assisted evolution of inositol pyrophosphate signaling, and we discuss the potential biogeochemical significance of TvIPK in soil niches.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of chiral amino alcohols derived from our previously disclosed clinical LTA4H inhibitor <b>LYS006</b> is described. In a biochemical assay, their optical antipodes showed similar potencies, which could be rationalized by the cocrystal structures of these compounds bound to LTA4H. Despite comparable stabilities in liver microsomes, they showed distinct in vivo PK properties. Selective <i>O</i>-phosphorylation of the (<i>R</i>)-enantiomers in blood led to clearance values above the hepatic blood flow, whereas the (<i>S</i>)-enantiomers were unaffected and exhibited satisfactory metabolic stabilities in vivo. Introduction of two pyrazole rings led to compound (<i>S</i>)-<b>2</b> with a more balanced distribution of polarity across the molecule, exhibiting high selectivity and excellent potency in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, compound (<i>S</i>)-<b>2</b> showed favorable profiles in 16-week IND-enabling toxicology studies in dogs and rats. Based on allometric scaling and potency in whole blood, compound (<i>S</i>)-<b>2</b> has the potential for a low oral efficacious dose administered once daily.",

    "abstract": "Sterol lipids are widely present in eukaryotes and play essential roles in signaling and modulating membrane fluidity. Although rare, some bacteria also produce sterols, but their function in bacteria is not known. Moreover, many more species, including pathogens and commensal microbes, acquire or modify sterols from eukaryotic hosts through poorly understood molecular mechanisms. The aerobic methanotroph <i>Methylococcus capsulatus</i> was the first bacterium shown to synthesize sterols, producing a mixture of C-4 methylated sterols that are distinct from those observed in eukaryotes. C-4 methylated sterols are synthesized in the cytosol and localized to the outer membrane, suggesting that a bacterial sterol transport machinery exists. Until now, the identity of such machinery remained a mystery. In this study, we identified three novel proteins that may be the first examples of transporters for bacterial sterol lipids. The proteins, which all belong to well-studied families of bacterial metabolite transporters, are predicted to reside in the inner membrane, periplasm, and outer membrane of <i>M. capsulatus,</i> and may work as a conduit to move modified sterols to the outer membrane. Quantitative analysis of ligand binding revealed their remarkable specificity for 4-methylsterols, and crystallographic structures coupled with docking and molecular dynamics simulations revealed the structural bases for substrate binding by two of the putative transporters. Their striking structural divergence from eukaryotic sterol transporters signals that they form a distinct sterol transport system within the bacterial domain. Finally, bioinformatics revealed the widespread presence of similar transporters in bacterial genomes, including in some pathogens that use host sterol lipids to construct their cell envelopes. The unique folds of these bacterial sterol binding proteins should now guide the discovery of other proteins that handle this essential metabolite.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear import of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) nucleocapsid is essential for replication that occurs in the nucleus. The ~360-angstrom HBV capsid translocates to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) as an intact particle, hijacking human importins in a reaction stimulated by host kinases. This paper describes the mechanisms of HBV capsid recognition by importins. We found that importin \u03b11 binds a nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the far end of the HBV coat protein Cp183 carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD). This NLS is exposed to the capsid surface through a pore at the icosahedral quasi-sixfold vertex. Phosphorylation at serine-155, serine-162, and serine-170 promotes CTD compaction but does not affect the affinity for importin \u03b11. The binding of 30 importin \u03b11/\u03b21 augments HBV capsid diameter to ~620 angstroms, close to the maximum size trafficable through the NPC. We propose that phosphorylation favors CTD externalization and prompts its compaction at the capsid surface, exposing the NLS to importins.",

The characteristic motif of the loop-bulge structure has also been found in other RNAs including CUUGU and CUGGC pentaloops. Along with the recently found T-hairpin structure with a UUUGAUU loop, in which UUUGA pentaloop and UU bulge are formed, the loop-bulge structures can be categorized as an RNA motif and it may be called as the integrated structure loop, I-loop.",

Among these, FZD6 is closely associated with lens development. Understanding FZD activation mechanism is key to unlock these emerging targets. Here we present the cryo-EM structures of FZD6 and FZD3 which are known to relay non-canonical planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling pathways as well as FZD1 in their G protein-coupled states and in the apo inactive states, respectively. Comparison of the three inactive/active pairs unveiled a shared activation framework among all ten FZDs. Mutagenesis along with imaging and functional analysis on the human lens epithelial tissues suggested potential crosstalk between the G-protein coupling of FZD6 and the PCP signaling pathways. Together, this study provides an integrated understanding of FZD structure and function, and lays the foundation for developing therapeutic modulators to activate or inhibit FZD signaling for a range of disorders including cancers and cataracts.",

    "abstract": "It was recently shown that bacteria use, apart from CRISPR-Cas and restriction systems, a considerable diversity of phage resistance systems<sup>1-4</sup>, but it is largely unknown how phages cope with this multilayered bacterial immunity. Here we analysed groups of closely related Bacillus phages that showed differential sensitivity to bacterial defence systems, and discovered four distinct families of anti-defence proteins that inhibit the Gabija, Thoeris and Hachiman systems. We show that these proteins Gad1, Gad2, Tad2 and Had1 efficiently cancel the defensive activity when co-expressed with the respective defence system or introduced into phage genomes. Homologues of these anti-defence proteins are found in hundreds of phages that infect taxonomically diverse bacterial species. We show that the anti-Gabija protein Gad1 blocks the ability of the Gabija defence complex to cleave phage-derived DNA. Our data further reveal that the anti-Thoeris protein Tad2 is a 'sponge' that sequesters the immune signalling molecules produced by Thoeris TIR-domain proteins in response to phage\u00a0infection. Our results demonstrate that phages encode an arsenal of anti-defence proteins that can disable a variety of bacterial defence mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "TRIM71 is an RNA-binding protein with ubiquitin ligase activity. Numerous functions of mammalian TRIM71, including cell cycle regulation, embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal, and reprogramming of pluripotent stem cells, are related to its RNA-binding property. We previously reported that a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) Trincr1 interacts with mouse TRIM71 (mTRIM71) to repress FGF/ERK pathway in mouse ESCs (mESCs). Herein, we identify an RNA motif specifically recognized by mTRIM71 from Trincr1 RNA, and solve the crystal structure of the NHL domain of mTRIM71 complexed with the RNA motif. Similar to the zebrafish TRIM71, mTRIM71 binds to a stem-loop structured RNA fragment of Trincr1, and an adenosine base at the loop region is crucial for the mTRIM71 interaction. We map similar hairpin RNAs preferably bound by TRIM71 in the mRNA UTRs of the cell-cycle related genes regulated by TRIM71. Furthermore, we identify key residues of mTRIM71, conserved among mammalian TRIM71 proteins, required for the RNA-binding property. Single-site mutations of these residues significantly impair the binding of TRIM71 to hairpin RNAs in vitro and to mRNAs of Cdkn1a/p21 and Rbl2/p130 in mESCs. Furthermore, congenital hydrocephalus (CH) specific mutation of mTRIM71 impair its binding to the RNA targets as well. These results reveal molecular mechanism behind the recognition of RNA by mammalian TRIM71 and provide insights into TRIM71 related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Continual evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) virus has allowed for its gradual evasion of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) produced in response to natural infection or vaccination. The rapid nature of these changes has incited a need for the development of superior broad nAbs (bnAbs) and/or the rational design of an antibody cocktail that can protect against the mutated virus strain. Here, we report two angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 competing nAbs-8H12 and 3E2-with synergistic neutralization but evaded by some Omicron subvariants. Cryo-electron microscopy reveals the two nAbs synergistic neutralizing virus through a rigorous pairing permitted by rearrangement of the 472-489 loop in the receptor-binding domain to avoid steric clashing. Bispecific antibodies based on these two nAbs tremendously extend the neutralizing breadth and restore neutralization against recent variants including currently dominant XBB.1.5. Together, these findings expand our understanding of the potential strategies for the neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants toward the design of broad-acting antibody therapeutics and vaccines.",

    "abstract": "The repeat emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC) with decreased susceptibility to vaccine-elicited antibodies highlights the need to develop next-generation vaccine candidates that confer broad protection. Here we describe the antibody response induced by the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Ferritin Nanoparticle (SpFN) vaccine candidate adjuvanted with the Army Liposomal Formulation including QS21 (ALFQ) in non-human primates. By isolating and characterizing several monoclonal antibodies directed against the Spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), N-Terminal Domain (NTD), or the S2 Domain, we define the molecular recognition of vaccine-elicited cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) elicited by SpFN. We identify six neutralizing antibodies with broad sarbecovirus cross-reactivity that recapitulate serum polyclonal antibody responses. In particular, RBD mAb WRAIR-5001 binds to the conserved cryptic region with high affinity to sarbecovirus clades 1 and 2, including Omicron variants, while\u00a0mAb WRAIR-5021 offers complete protection from B.1.617.2 (Delta) in a murine challenge study. Our data further highlight the ability of SpFN vaccination to stimulate cross-reactive B cells targeting conserved regions of the Spike with activity against SARS CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 variants.",

    "abstract": "The efficacy of aminoglycoside antibiotics is waning due to the acquisition of diverse resistance mechanisms by bacteria. Among the most prevalent are aminoglycoside acetyltransferases (AACs) that inactivate the antibiotics through acetyl coenzyme A-mediated modification. Most AACs are members of the GCN5 superfamily of acyltransferases which lack conserved active site residues that participate in catalysis. ApmA is the first reported AAC belonging to the left-handed \u03b2-helix superfamily. These enzymes are characterized by an essential active site histidine that acts as an active site base. Here we show that ApmA confers broad-spectrum aminoglycoside resistance with a molecular mechanism that diverges from other detoxifying left-handed \u03b2-helix superfamily enzymes and canonical GCN5 AACs. We find that the active site histidine plays different functions depending on the acetyl-accepting aminoglycoside substrate. This flexibility in the mechanism of a single enzyme underscores the plasticity of antibiotic resistance elements to co-opt protein catalysts in the evolution of drug detoxification.",

    "abstract": "The functions of the bromodomain and extra terminal (BET) family of proteins have been proved to be involved in various diseases, particularly the acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this work, guided by free energy perturbation (FEP) calculation, a methyl group was selected to be attached to the 1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline skeleton, and a series of congeneric compounds were synthesized. Among them, compound 10 demonstrated outstanding activity against BRD4 BD1 with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.9\u00a0nM and exhibited remarkable antiproliferative effects against MV4-11\u00a0cells. The X-ray cocrystal structure proved that 10 occupied the acetylated lysine (KAc) binding cavity and the WPF shelf of BRD4 BD1. Additionally, 10 displayed high selectivity towards BET family members, effectively inhibiting the growth of AML cells, promoting apoptosis, and arresting the cell cycle at the G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase. Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that compound 10 could suppress the expression of c-Myc and CDK6 while enhancing the expression of P21, PARP, and cleaved PARP. Moreover, 10 exhibited remarkable pharmacokinetic properties and significant antitumor efficacy in vivo. Therefore, compound 10 may represent a new, potent and selective BET bromodomain inhibitor for the development of therapeutics to treat AML.",

Mitotic entry is initiated by increased phosphorylation of mitotic proteins, a process driven by kinases<sup>2</sup>, whereas mitotic exit is achieved by counteracting dephosphorylation, a process driven by phosphatases, especially PP2A:B55<sup>3</sup>. Although the role of kinases in mitotic entry is well established, recent data have shown that mitosis is only successfully initiated when the counterbalancing phosphatases are also inhibited<sup>4</sup>. Inhibition of PP2A:B55 is achieved by the intrinsically disordered proteins ARPP19<sup>5,6</sup> and FAM122A<sup>7</sup>. Despite their critical roles in mitosis, the mechanisms by which they achieve PP2A:B55 inhibition is unknown. Here, we report the single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structures of PP2A:B55 bound to phosphorylated ARPP19 and FAM122A. Consistent with our complementary NMR spectroscopy studies, both intrinsically disordered proteins bind PP2A:B55, but do so in highly distinct manners, leveraging multiple distinct binding sites on B55. Our extensive structural, biophysical and biochemical data explain how substrates and inhibitors are recruited to PP2A:B55 and provide a molecular roadmap for the development of therapeutic interventions for PP2A:B55-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Sparse and short-lived excited RNA conformational states are essential players in cell physiology, disease, and therapeutic development, yet determining their 3D structures remains challenging. Combining mutagenesis, NMR spectroscopy, and computational modeling, we determined the 3D structural ensemble formed by a short-lived (lifetime ~2.1\u2009ms) lowly-populated (~0.4%) conformational state in HIV-1 TAR RNA. Through a strand register shift, the excited conformational state completely remodels the 3D structure of the ground state (RMSD from the ground state = 7.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9\u2009\u00c5), forming a surprisingly more ordered conformational ensemble rich in non-canonical mismatches. The structure impedes the formation of the motifs recognized by Tat and the super elongation complex, explaining why this alternative TAR conformation cannot activate HIV-1 transcription. The ability to determine the 3D structures of fleeting RNA states using the presented methodology holds great promise for our understanding of RNA biology, disease mechanisms, and the development of RNA-targeting therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is delivered to the virion assembly site in the ER-Golgi Intermediate Compartment (ERGIC) from both the ER and cis-Golgi in infected cells. However, the relevance and modulatory mechanism of this bidirectional trafficking are unclear. Here, using structure-function analyses, we show that S incorporation into\u00a0virus-like particles (VLP) and VLP fusogenicity are determined by coatomer-dependent S delivery from the cis-Golgi and restricted by S-coatomer dissociation. Although S mimicry of the host coatomer-binding dibasic motif ensures retrograde trafficking to the ERGIC, avoidance of the host-like C-terminal acidic residue is critical for S-coatomer dissociation and therefore incorporation into virions or export for cell-cell fusion. Because this C-terminal residue is the key determinant of SARS-CoV-2 assembly and fusogenicity, our work provides a framework for the export of S protein encoded in genetic vaccines for surface display and immune activation.",

    "abstract": "Tryptophan hydroxylases catalyze the first and rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of serotonin, a well-known neurotransmitter that plays an important role in multiple physiological functions. A reduction of serotonin levels, especially in the brain, can cause dysregulation leading to depression or insomnia. In contrast, overproduction of peripheral serotonin is associated with symptoms like carcinoid syndrome and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Recently, we developed a class of TPH inhibitors based on xanthine-benzimidazoles, characterized by a tripartite-binding mode spanning the binding sites of the cosubstrate pterin and the substrate tryptophan and by chelation of the catalytic iron ion. Herein, we describe the structure-based development of a second generation of xanthine-imidiazopyridines and -imidazothiazoles designed to inhibit TPH1 in the periphery while preventing the interaction with TPH2 in the brain. Lead compound <b>32</b> (TPT-004) shows superior pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties as well as efficacy in preclinical models of peripheral serotonin attenuation and colorectal tumor growth.",

    "abstract": "Correlated super-resolution cryo-fluorescence and cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) has been gaining popularity as a method to investigate biological samples with high resolution and specificity. A concern in this combined method (called SR-cryoCLEM), however, is whether and how fluorescence imaging prior to cryoEM acquisition is detrimental to sample integrity. In this report, we investigated the effect of high-dose laser light (405, 488, and 561\u00a0nm) irradiation on apoferritin samples prepared for cryoEM with excitation wavelengths commonly used in fluorescence microscopy, and compared these samples to controls that were kept in the dark. We found that laser illumination, of equal duration and intensity as used in cryo-single molecule localization microscopy (cryoSMLM) and in the presence of high concentrations of fluorescent protein, did not affect the achievable resolution in cryoEM, with final reconstructions reaching resolutions of\u00a0\u223c\u00a01.8\u00a0\u00c5 regardless of the laser illumination. The finding that super-resolution fluorescence imaging of cryosamples prior to cryoEM data acquisition does not limit the achievable resolution suggests that super-resolution cryo-fluorescence microscopy and in situ structural biology using cryoEM are entirely compatible.",

    "abstract": "SIR2-HerA, a bacterial two-protein anti-phage defense system, induces bacterial death by depleting NAD<sup>+</sup> upon phage infection. Biochemical reconstitution of SIR2, HerA, and the SIR2-HerA complex reveals a dynamic assembly process. Unlike other ATPases, HerA can form various oligomers, ranging from dimers to nonamers. When assembled with SIR2, HerA forms a hexamer and converts SIR2 from a nuclease to an NAD<sup>+</sup> hydrolase, representing an unexpected regulatory mechanism mediated by protein assembly. Furthermore, high concentrations of ATP can inhibit NAD<sup>+</sup> hydrolysis by the SIR2-HerA complex. Cryo-EM structures of the SIR2-HerA complex reveal a giant supramolecular assembly up to 1 MDa, with SIR2 as a dodecamer and HerA as a hexamer, crucial for anti-phage defense. Unexpectedly, the HerA hexamer resembles a spiral staircase and exhibits helicase activities toward dual-forked DNA. Together, we reveal the supramolecular assembly of SIR2-HerA as a unique mechanism for switching enzymatic activities and bolstering anti-phage defense strategies.",

In contrast with the <i>aa<sub>3</sub></i>-type enzyme, our data show how CO is stabilized on Cu<sub>B</sub> through interactions with a transiently ordered water molecule. These results offer a structural explanation for the extended lifetime of the Cu<sub>B</sub>-CO complex in <i>ba<sub>3</sub></i>-type C<i>c</i>O and, by extension, the extremely high oxygen affinity of the enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Structural and mechanistic studies on human odorant receptors (ORs), key in olfactory signaling, are challenging because of their low surface expression in heterologous cells. The recent structure of OR51E2 bound to propionate provided molecular insight into odorant recognition, but the lack of an inactive OR structure limited understanding of the activation mechanism of ORs upon odorant binding. Here, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structures of consensus OR52 (OR52<sub>cs</sub>), a representative of the OR52 family, in the ligand-free (apo) and octanoate-bound states. The apo structure of OR52<sub>cs</sub> reveals a large opening between transmembrane helices (TMs) 5 and 6. A comparison between the apo and active structures of OR52<sub>cs</sub> demonstrates the inward and outward movements of the extracellular and intracellular segments of TM6, respectively. These results, combined with molecular dynamics simulations and signaling assays, shed light on the molecular mechanisms of odorant binding and activation of the OR52 family.",

    "abstract": "The C-C motif chemokine receptor 8 (CCR8) is a class A G-protein coupled receptor that has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in cancer. Targeting CCR8 with an antibody has appeared to be an attractive therapeutic approach, but the molecular basis for chemokine-mediated activation and antibody-mediated inhibition of CCR8 are not fully elucidated. Here, we obtain an antagonist antibody against human CCR8 and determine structures of CCR8 in complex with either the antibody or the endogenous agonist ligand CCL1. Our studies reveal characteristic antibody features allowing recognition of the CCR8 extracellular loops and CCL1-CCR8 interaction modes that are distinct from other chemokine receptor - ligand pairs. Informed by these structural insights, we demonstrate that CCL1 follows a two-step, two-site binding sequence to CCR8 and that antibody-mediated inhibition of CCL1 signaling can occur by preventing the second binding event. Together, our results provide a detailed structural and mechanistic framework of CCR8 activation and inhibition that expands our molecular understanding of chemokine - receptor interactions and offers insight into the development of therapeutic antibodies targeting chemokine GPCRs.",

However, structural information about intermediate species has been scarce and the molecular mechanisms by which amyloids assemble remain largely unknown. Here we use time-resolved cryogenic electron microscopy to study the in vitro assembly of recombinant truncated tau (amino acid residues 297-391) into paired helical filaments of Alzheimer's disease or into filaments of chronic traumatic encephalopathy<sup>3</sup>. We report the formation of a shared first intermediate amyloid\u00a0filament, with an ordered core comprising residues 302-316. Nuclear magnetic resonance indicates that the same residues adopt rigid, \u03b2-strand-like conformations in monomeric tau. At later time points, the first intermediate amyloid disappears and we observe many different intermediate amyloid filaments, with structures that depend on the reaction conditions. At the end of both assembly reactions, most intermediate amyloids disappear and filaments with the same ordered cores as those from human brains remain. Our results provide structural insights into the processes of primary and secondary nucleation of amyloid assembly, with implications for the design of new therapies.",

    "abstract": "LarB catalyzes the first step of biosynthesis for the nickel-pincer nucleotide cofactor by converting nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD) to AMP and pyridinium-3,5-biscarboxylic acid mononucleotide (P2CMN). Prior studies had shown that LarB uses CO<sub>2</sub> for substrate carboxylation and reported the structure of a <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> LarB\u00b7NAD<sup>+</sup> complex, revealing a covalent linkage between Cys221 and C4 of the pyridine ring. This interaction was proposed to promote C5 carboxylation, with C5-carboxylated-NaAD suggested to activate magnesium-bound water, leading to phosphoanhydride hydrolysis. Here, we extended the analysis of wild-type LarB by using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy to obtain additional evidence for cysteinyl side chain attachment to the ring of NAD<sup>+</sup>, thus demonstrating that this linkage is not a crystallization artifact. Using the S127A variant of <i>L. plantarum</i> LarB, a form of the enzyme with a reduced rate of NaAD hydrolysis, we examined its interaction with the authentic substrate. The intermediate arising from C5 carboxylation of NaAD, dinicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (DaAD), was identified by using mass spectrometry. S127A LarB exhibited spectroscopic evidence of a Cys221-NAD<sup>+</sup> adduct, but a covalent enzyme-NaAD linkage was not detectable. We determined the S127A LarB\u00b7NaAD structure, providing new insights into the enzyme mechanism, and tentatively identified the position and mode of CO<sub>2</sub> binding. The crystal structure revealed the location of the side chain for Glu180, which was previously disordered, but showed that it is not well positioned to abstract the C5 proton in the adduct species to restore aromaticity as Cys221 is expelled. Based on these combined results, we propose a revised catalytic mechanism of LarB..",

Development of host-directed antivirals offers broad-spectrum intervention against different variants of concern. Host proteases, TMPRSS2 and CTSL/CTSB cleave the SARS-CoV-2 spike to play a crucial role in the two alternative pathways of viral entry and are characterized as promising pharmacological targets. Here, we identify compounds that show potent inhibition of these proteases and determine their complex structures with their respective targets. Furthermore, we show that applying inhibitors simultaneously that block both entry pathways has a synergistic antiviral effect. Notably, we devise a bispecific compound, 212-148, exhibiting the dual-inhibition ability of both TMPRSS2 and CTSL/CTSB, and demonstrate antiviral activity against various SARS-CoV-2 variants with different viral entry profiles. Our findings offer an alternative approach for the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, as well as application for broad-spectrum treatment of viral pathogenic infections with similar entry pathways.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between RNA and proteins are the cornerstone of many important biological processes from transcription and translation to gene regulation, yet little is known about the ancient origin of said interactions. We hypothesized that peptide amyloids played a role in the origin of life and that their repetitive structure lends itself to building interfaces with other polymers through avidity. Here, we report that short RNA with a minimum length of three nucleotides binds in a sequence-dependent manner to peptide amyloids. The 3'-5' linked RNA backbone appears to be well-suited to support these interactions, with the phosphodiester backbone and nucleobases both contributing to the affinity. Sequence-specific RNA-peptide interactions of the kind identified here may provide a path to understanding one of the great mysteries rooted in the origin of life: the origin of the genetic code.",

    "abstract": "A novel class of benzoxaboroles was reported to induce cancer cell death but the mechanism was unknown. Using a forward genetics platform, we discovered mutations in cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 3 (CPSF3) that reduce benzoxaborole binding and confer resistance. CPSF3 is the endonuclease responsible for pre-mRNA 3'-end processing, which is also important for RNA polymerase II transcription termination. Benzoxaboroles inhibit this endonuclease activity of CPSF3 in\u00a0vitro and also curb transcriptional termination in cells, which results in the downregulation of numerous constitutively expressed genes. Furthermore, we used X-ray crystallography to demonstrate that benzoxaboroles bind to the active site of CPSF3 in a manner distinct from the other known inhibitors of CPSF3. The benzoxaborole compound impeded the growth of cancer cell lines derived from different lineages. Our results suggest benzoxaboroles may represent a promising lead as CPSF3 inhibitors for clinical development.",

    "abstract": "Many AAA+ (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) proteins function as protein or DNA remodelers by threading the substrate through the central pore of their hexameric assemblies. In this ATP-dependent translocating state, the substrate is gripped by the pore loops of the ATPase domains arranged in a universal right-handed spiral staircase organization. However, the process by which a AAA+ protein is activated to adopt this substrate-pore-loop arrangement remains unknown. We show here, using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), that the activation process of the Lon AAA+ protease may involve a pentameric assembly and a substrate-dependent incorporation of the sixth protomer to form the substrate-pore-loop contacts seen in the translocating state. Based on the structural results, we design truncated monomeric mutants that inhibit Lon activity by binding to the native pentamer and demonstrated that expressing these monomeric mutants in Escherichia coli cells containing functional Lon elicits specific phenotypes associated with lon\u00a0deficiency, including the inhibition of persister cell formation. These findings uncover a substrate-dependent assembly process for the activation of a AAA+ protein and demonstrate a targeted approach to selectively inhibit its function within cells.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophage P22 is a prototypical member of the Podoviridae superfamily. Since its discovery in 1952, P22 has become a paradigm for phage transduction and a model for icosahedral viral capsid assembly. Here, we describe the complete architecture of the P22 tail apparatus (gp1, gp4, gp10, gp9, and gp26) and the potential location and organization of P22 ejection proteins (gp7, gp20, and gp16), determined using cryo-EM localized reconstruction, genetic knockouts, and biochemical analysis. We found that the tail apparatus exists in two equivalent conformations, rotated by \u223c6\u00b0 relative to the capsid. Portal protomers make unique contacts with coat subunits in both conformations, explaining the 12:5 symmetry mismatch. The tail assembles around the hexameric tail hub (gp10), which folds into an interrupted \u03b2-propeller characterized by an apical insertion domain. The tail hub connects proximally to the dodecameric portal protein and head-to-tail adapter (gp4), distally to the trimeric tail needle (gp26), and laterally to six trimeric tailspikes (gp9) that attach asymmetrically to gp10 insertion domain. Cryo-EM analysis of P22 mutants lacking the ejection proteins gp7 or gp20 and biochemical analysis of purified recombinant proteins suggest that gp7 and gp20 form a molecular complex associated with the tail apparatus via the portal protein barrel. We identified a putative signal transduction pathway from the tailspike to the tail needle, mediated by three flexible loops in the tail hub, that explains how lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is sufficient to trigger the ejection of the P22 DNA in vitro.",

    "abstract": "Quorum sensing (QS) is a crucial regulatory mechanism controlling bacterial signalling and holds promise for novel therapies against antimicrobial resistance. In Gram-positive bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, ComA is a conserved efflux pump responsible for the maturation and secretion of peptide signals, including the competence-stimulating peptide (CSP), yet its structure and function remain unclear. Here, we functionally characterize ComA as an ABC transporter with high ATP affinity and determined its cryo-EM structures in the presence or absence of CSP or nucleotides. Our findings reveal a network of strong electrostatic interactions unique to ComA at the intracellular gate, a putative binding pocket for two CSP molecules, and negatively charged residues facilitating CSP translocation. Mutations of these residues affect ComA's peptidase activity in-vitro and prevent CSP export in-vivo. We demonstrate that ATP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> triggers the outward-facing conformation of ComA for CSP release, rather than ATP alone. Our study provides molecular insights into the QS signal peptide secretion, highlighting potential targets for QS-targeting drugs.",

    "abstract": "Trace-amine-associated receptors (TAARs), a group of biogenic amine receptors, have essential roles in neurological and metabolic homeostasis<sup>1</sup>. They recognize diverse endogenous trace amines and subsequently activate a range of G-protein-subtype signalling pathways<sup>2,3</sup>. Notably, TAAR1 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for treating psychiatric disorders<sup>4,5</sup>. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its ability to recognize different ligands remain largely unclear. Here we present nine cryo-electron microscopy structures, with eight showing human and mouse TAAR1 in a complex with an array of ligands, including the endogenous 3-iodothyronamine, two antipsychotic agents, the psychoactive drug amphetamine and two identified catecholamine agonists, and one showing 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R in a complex with an antipsychotic agent. These structures reveal a rigid consensus binding motif in TAAR1 that binds to endogenous trace amine stimuli and two extended binding pockets that accommodate diverse chemotypes. Combined with mutational analysis, functional assays and molecular dynamic simulations, we elucidate the structural basis of drug polypharmacology and identify the species-specific differences between human and mouse TAAR1. Our study provides insights into the mechanism of ligand recognition and G-protein selectivity by TAAR1, which may help in the discovery of ligands or therapeutic strategies for neurological and metabolic disorders.",

Three stereochemically distinct CPPs have been found in plants, namely (+)-CPP, ent-CPP and syn-CPP. Here, we used X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM methods to describe different oligomeric structures of a syn-copalyl diphosphate synthase from Oryza sativa (OsCyc1), and provided a cryo-EM structure of OsCyc1<sup>D367A</sup> mutant in complex with the substrate GGPP. Further analysis showed that tetramers are the dominant form of OsCyc1 in solution and are not necessary for enzyme activity in vitro. Through rational design, we identified an OsCyc1 mutant that can generate ent-CPP in addition to syn-CPP. Our work provides a structural and mechanistic basis for comparing different CPSs and paves the way for further enzyme design to obtain diterpene derivatives with specific chirality.",

Here, we determined two crystal structures of RGLG2 VWA domain, representing two conformations, open and closed, respectively. The two structures reveal that Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are allosteric regulators of RGLG2-VWA, which adopts open state when NCBS1(Novel Calcium ions Binding Site 1) binds Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and switches to closed state after Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are removed. This mechanism of allosteric regulation is identical to RGLG1-VWA, but distinct from integrin \u03b1 and \u03b2 VWA domains. Therefore, our data provide a backdrop for understanding the role of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions in conformational change of VWA domain. In addition, we found that RGLG2<sup>closed</sup>, corresponding to low affinity, can bind pseudo-ligand, which has never been observed in other VWA domains.",

    "abstract": "The thick filament is a key component of sarcomeres, the basic units of striated muscle<sup>1</sup>. Alterations in thick filament proteins are associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and other heart and muscle diseases<sup>2</sup>. Despite the central importance of the thick filament, its molecular organization remains unclear. Here we present the molecular architecture of native cardiac sarcomeres in the relaxed state, determined by cryo-electron tomography. Our reconstruction of the thick filament reveals the three-dimensional organization of myosin, titin and myosin-binding protein C (MyBP-C). The arrangement of myosin molecules is dependent on their position along the filament, suggesting specialized capacities in terms of strain susceptibility and force generation. Three pairs of titin-\u03b1 and titin-\u03b2 chains run axially along the filament, intertwining with myosin tails and probably orchestrating the length-dependent activation of the sarcomere. Notably, whereas the three titin-\u03b1 chains run along the entire length of the thick filament, titin-\u03b2 chains\u00a0do not. The structure also demonstrates that MyBP-C bridges thin and thick filaments, with its carboxy-terminal region binding to the myosin tails and directly stabilizing the OFF state of the myosin heads in an unforeseen manner. These results provide a foundation for future research investigating muscle disorders involving sarcomeric components.",

    "abstract": "Norovirus is the leading cause of viral gastroenteritis worldwide, and there are no approved vaccines or therapeutic treatments for chronic or severe norovirus infections. The structural characterisation of the norovirus protease and drug development has predominantly focused upon GI.1 noroviruses, despite most global outbreaks being caused by GII.4 noroviruses. Here, we determined the crystal structures of the GII.4 Sydney 2012 ligand-free norovirus protease at 2.79 \u00c5 and at 1.83 \u00c5 with a covalently bound high-affinity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.37 \u00b5M) protease inhibitor (NV-004). We show that the active sites of the ligand-free protease structure are present in both open and closed conformations, as determined by their Arg112 side chain orientation. A comparative analysis of the ligand-free and ligand-bound protease structures reveals significant structural differences in the active site cleft and substrate-binding pockets when an inhibitor is covalently bound. We also report a second molecule of NV-004 non-covalently bound within the S4 substrate binding pocket via hydrophobic contacts and a water-mediated hydrogen bond. These new insights can guide structure-aided drug design against the GII.4 genogroup of noroviruses.",

    "abstract": "Medicinal chemistry has discovered thousands of potent protein and lipid kinase inhibitors. These may be developed into therapeutic drugs or chemical probes to study kinase biology. Because of polypharmacology, a large part of the human kinome currently lacks selective chemical probes. To discover such probes, we profiled 1,183 compounds from drug discovery projects in lysates of cancer cell lines using Kinobeads. The resulting 500,000 compound-target interactions are available in ProteomicsDB and we exemplify how this molecular resource may be used. For instance, the data revealed several hundred reasonably selective compounds for 72 kinases. Cellular assays validated GSK986310C as a candidate SYK (spleen tyrosine kinase) probe and X-ray crystallography uncovered the structural basis for the observed selectivity of the CK2 inhibitor GW869516X. Compounds targeting PKN3 were discovered and phosphoproteomics identified substrates that indicate target engagement in cells. We anticipate that this molecular resource will aid research in drug discovery and chemical biology.",

    "abstract": "Observing proteins as they perform their tasks has largely remained elusive, which has left our understanding of protein function fundamentally incomplete. To enable such observations, we have recently proposed a technique that improves the time resolution of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to microseconds. Here, we demonstrate that microsecond time-resolved cryo-EM enables observations of fast protein dynamics. We use our approach to elucidate the mechanics of the capsid of cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV), whose large-amplitude motions play a crucial role in the viral life cycle. We observe that a pH jump causes the extended configuration of the capsid to contract on the microsecond timescale. While this is a concerted process, the motions of the capsid proteins involve different timescales, leading to a curved reaction path. It is difficult to conceive how such a detailed picture of the dynamics could have been obtained with any other method, which highlights the potential of our technique. Crucially, our experiments pave the way for microsecond time-resolved cryo-EM to be applied to a broad range of protein dynamics that previously could not have been observed. This promises to fundamentally advance our understanding of protein function.",

Among VH3-33 antibodies, cross-reactivity between PfCSP major repeat (NANP), minor (NVDP), and junctional (NPDP) motifs is associated with high affinity and potent parasite inhibition. However, the molecular basis of antibody cross-reactivity and the relationship with efficacy remain unresolved. Here, we perform an extensive structure-function characterization of 12 VH3-33 anti-PfCSP monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with varying degrees of cross-reactivity induced by immunization of mice expressing a human immunoglobulin gene repertoire. We identify residues in the antibody paratope that mediate cross-reactive binding and delineate four distinct epitope conformations induced by antibody binding, with one consistently associated with high protective efficacy and another that confers comparably potent inhibition of parasite liver invasion. Our data show a link between molecular features of cross-reactive VH3-33 mAb binding to PfCSP and mAb potency, relevant for the development of antibody-based interventions against malaria.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 viruses are highly transmissible and immune evasive. It is critical to develop broad-spectrum prophylactic and therapeutic antibodies for potential future pandemics. Here, we used the phage display method to discover nanobodies (Nbs) for neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 viruses especially Omicron strains. The leading nanobody (Nb), namely, Nb4, with excellent physicochemical properties, can neutralize Delta and Omicron subtypes, including BA.1, BA.1.1 (BA.1\u00a0+\u00a0R346K), BA.2, BA.5, BQ.1, and XBB.1. The crystal structure of Nb4 in complex with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of BA.1 Spike protein reveals that Nb4 interacts with an epitope on the RBD overlapping with the receptor-binding motif, and thus competes with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding. Nb4 is expected to be effective for neutralizing most recent Omicron variants, since the epitopes are evolutionarily conserved among them. Indeed, trivalent Nb4 interacts with the XBB1.5 Spike protein with low nM affinity and competes for ACE2 binding. Prophylactic and therapeutic experiments in mice indicated that Nb4 could reduce the Omicron virus loads in the lung. In particular, in prophylactic experiments, intranasal administration of multivalent Nb4 completely protected mice from Omicron infection. Taken together, these results demonstrated that Nb4 could serve as a potent and broad-spectrum prophylactic and therapeutic Nb for COVID-19.",

The two major groups, green FPs (GFPs) and red FPs (RFPs), have distinct fluorophore structures; RFPs have an extended \u03c0-conjugation system with an additional double bond. However, due to the low sequence homology between the two groups, amino acid residues essential for determining the different fluorophore structures were unclear. Therefore, engineering a GFP into an RFP has been challenging, and the exact mechanism of how GFPs and RFPs achieve different autocatalytic reactions remained elucidated. Here, we show the conversion of two coral GFPs, AzamiGreen (AG) and mcavGFP, into RFPs by defined mutations. Structural comparison of AG and AzamiRed1.0, an AG-derived RFP, revealed that the mutations triggered drastic rearrangements in the interaction networks between amino acid residues around the fluorophore, suggesting that coordinated multisite mutations are required for the green-to-red conversion. As a result of the structural rearrangements, a cavity suitable for the entry of an oxygen molecule, which is necessary for the double bond formation of the red fluorophores, is created in the proximity of the fluorophore. We also show that a monomeric variant of AzamiRed1.0 can be used for labeling organelles and proteins in mammalian cells. Our results provide a structural basis for understanding the red fluorophore formation mechanism and demonstrate that protein engineering of GFPs is a promising way to create RFPs suitable for fluorescent tags.",

An exception is Desulfovibrio vulgaris W/Sec-FdhAB, which can be handled aerobically, but the basis for this oxygen tolerance was unknown. Here we show that FdhAB activity is controlled by a redox switch based on an allosteric disulfide bond. When this bond is closed, the enzyme is in an oxygen-tolerant resting state presenting almost no catalytic activity and very low formate affinity. Opening this bond triggers large conformational changes that propagate to the active site, resulting in high activity and high formate affinity, but also higher oxygen sensitivity. We present the structure of activated FdhAB and show that activity loss is associated with partial loss of the metal sulfido ligand. The redox switch mechanism is reversible in vivo and prevents enzyme reduction by physiological formate levels, conferring a fitness advantage during O<sub>2</sub> exposure.",

    "abstract": "Abscisic acid (ABA) is one of the plant hormones that regulate various physiological processes, including stomatal closure, seed germination and development. ABA is synthesized mainly in vascular tissues and transported to distal sites to exert its physiological functions. Many ABA transporters have been identified, however, the molecular mechanism of ABA transport remains elusive. Here we report the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the Arabidopsis thaliana adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette G subfamily ABA exporter ABCG25 (AtABCG25) in inward-facing apo conformation, ABA-bound pre-translocation conformation and outward-facing occluded conformation. Structural and biochemical analyses reveal that the ABA bound with ABCG25 adopts a similar configuration as that in ABA receptors and that the ABA-specific binding is dictated by residues from transmembrane helices TM1, TM2 and TM5a of each protomer at the transmembrane domain interface. Comparison of different conformational structures reveals conformational changes, especially those of transmembrane helices and residues constituting the substrate translocation pathway during the cross-membrane transport process. Based on the structural data, a 'gate-flipper' translocation model of ABCG25-mediated ABA cross-membrane transport is proposed. Our structural data on AtABCG25 provide new clues to the physiological study of ABA and shed light on its potential applications in plants and agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Amino acids (AAs) with a noncanonical backbone would be a valuable tool for protein engineering, enabling new structural motifs and building blocks. To incorporate them into an expanded genetic code, the first, key step is to obtain an appropriate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Currently, directed evolution is not available to optimize AAs with noncanonical backbones, since an appropriate selective pressure has not been discovered. Computational protein design (CPD) is an alternative. We used a new CPD method to redesign MetRS and increase its activity towards \u03b2-Met, which has an extra backbone methylene. The new method considered a few active site positions for design and used a Monte Carlo exploration of the corresponding sequence space. During the exploration, a bias energy was adaptively learned, such that the free energy landscape of the apo enzyme was flattened. Enzyme variants could then be sampled, in the presence of the ligand and the bias energy, according to their \u03b2-Met binding affinities. Eighteen predicted variants were chosen for experimental testing; 10 exhibited detectable activity for \u03b2-Met adenylation. Top predicted hits were characterized experimentally in detail. Dissociation constants, catalytic rates, and Michaelis constants for both \u03b1-Met and \u03b2-Met were measured. The best mutant retained a preference for \u03b1-Met over \u03b2-Met; however, the preference was reduced, compared to the wildtype, by a factor of 29. For this mutant, high resolution crystal structures were obtained in complex with both \u03b1-Met and \u03b2-Met, indicating that the predicted, active conformation of \u03b2-Met in the active site was retained.",

    "abstract": "C-glycosides are natural products with important biological activities but are recalcitrant to degradation. Glycoside 3-oxidases (G3Oxs) are recently identified bacterial flavo-oxidases from the glucose-methanol-coline (GMC) superfamily that catalyze the oxidation of C-glycosides with the concomitant reduction of O<sub>2</sub> to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This oxidation is followed by C-C acid/base-assisted bond cleavage in two-step C-deglycosylation pathways. Soil and gut microorganisms have different oxidative enzymes, but the details of their catalytic mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we report that PsG3Ox oxidizes at 50,000-fold higher specificity (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>) the glucose moiety of mangiferin to 3-keto-mangiferin than free D-glucose to 2-keto-glucose. Analysis of PsG3Ox X-ray crystal structures and PsG3Ox in complex with glucose and mangiferin, combined with mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations, reveal distinctive features in the topology surrounding the active site that favor catalytically competent conformational states suitable for recognition, stabilization, and oxidation of the glucose moiety of mangiferin. Furthermore, their distinction to pyranose 2-oxidases (P2Oxs) involved in wood decay and recycling is discussed from an evolutionary, structural, and functional viewpoint.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas\u2009aeruginosa is a major human pathogen in the healthcare setting. The emergence of multi-drug-resistant and extensive drug-resistant P.\u2009aeruginosa is of great concern, and clearly indicates that new alternatives to current first-line antibiotics are required in the future. Inhibition of d-alanine-d-alanine production presents as a promising avenue as it is a key component in the essential process of cell wall biosynthesis. In P.\u2009aeruginosa, d-alanine-d-alanine production is facilitated by two isoforms, d-alanine-d-alanine ligase A (PaDdlA) and d-alanine-d-alanine ligase B (PaDdlA), but neither enzyme has been individually characterised to date. Here, we present the functional and structural characterisation of PaDdlA and PaDdlB, and assess their potential as antibiotic targets. This was achieved using a combination of in\u2009vitro enzyme-activity assays and X-ray crystallography. The former revealed that both isoforms effectively catalyse d-alanine-d-alanine production with near identical efficiency, and that this is effectively disrupted by the model d-alanine-d-alanine ligase inhibitor, d-cycloserine. Next, each isoform was co-crystallised with ATP and either d-alanine-d-alanine or d-cycloserine, allowing direct comparison of the key structural features. Both isoforms possess the same structural architecture and share a high level of conservation within the active site. Although residues forming the d-alanine pocket are completely conserved, the ATP-binding pocket possesses several amino acid substitutions resulting in a differing chemical environment around the ATP adenine base. Together, these findings support that the discovery of dual PaDdlA/PaDdlB competitive inhibitors is a viable approach for developing new antibiotics against P.\u2009aeruginosa.",

    "abstract": "The persistent pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its variants accentuates the great demand for developing effective therapeutic agents. Here, we report the development of an orally bioavailable SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease (3CL<sup>pro</sup>) inhibitor, namely simnotrelvir, and its preclinical evaluation, which lay the foundation for clinical trials studies as well as the conditional approval of simnotrelvir in combination with ritonavir for the treatment of COVID-19. The structure-based optimization of boceprevir, an approved HCV protease inhibitor, leads to identification of simnotrelvir that covalently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 3CL<sup>pro</sup> with an enthalpy-driven thermodynamic binding signature. Multiple enzymatic assays reveal that simnotrelvir is a potent pan-CoV\u00a03CL<sup>pro</sup> inhibitor but has high selectivity. It effectively blocks replications of SARS-CoV-2 variants in cell-based assays and exhibits good pharmacokinetic and safety profiles in male and female rats and monkeys, leading to robust oral efficacy in a male mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 Delta infection in which it not only significantly reduces lung viral loads but also eliminates the virus from brains. The discovery of simnotrelvir thereby highlights the utility of structure-based development of marked protease inhibitors for providing a small molecule therapeutic effectively combatting human coronaviruses.",

    "abstract": "The diaphanous-related formin, Diaphanous 1 (DIAPH1), is required for the assembly of Filamentous (F)-actin structures. DIAPH1 is an intracellular effector of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and contributes to RAGE signaling and effects such as increased cell migration upon RAGE stimulation. Mutations in DIAPH1, including those in the basic \"RRKR\" motif of its autoregulatory domain, diaphanous autoinhibitory domain (DAD), are implicated in hearing loss, macrothrombocytopenia, and cardiovascular diseases. The solution structure of the complex between the N-terminal inhibitory domain, DID, and the C-terminal DAD, resolved by NMR spectroscopy shows only transient interactions between DID and the basic motif of DAD, resembling those found in encounter complexes. Cross-linking studies placed the RRKR motif into the negatively charged cavity of DID. Neutralizing the cavity resulted in a 5-fold decrease in the binding affinity and 4-fold decrease in the association rate constant of DAD for DID, indicating that the RRKR interactions with DID form a productive encounter complex. A DIAPH1 mutant containing a neutralized RRKR binding cavity shows excessive colocalization with actin and is unresponsive to RAGE stimulation. This is the first demonstration of a specific alteration of the surfaces responsible for productive encounter complexation with implications for human pathology.",

Our approach leveraged crowdsourcing, machine learning, exascale molecular simulations, and high-throughput structural biology and chemistry. We generated a detailed map of the structural plasticity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, extensive structure-activity relationships for multiple chemotypes, and a wealth of biochemical activity data. All compound designs (>18,000 designs), crystallographic data (>490 ligand-bound x-ray structures), assay data (>10,000 measurements), and synthesized molecules (>2400 compounds) for this campaign were shared rapidly and openly, creating a rich, open, and intellectual property-free knowledge base for future anticoronavirus drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "BTR1 (SLC4A11) is a NH<sub>3</sub> stimulated H<sup>+</sup> (OH<sup>-</sup>) transporter belonging to the SLC4 family. Dysfunction of BTR1 leads to diseases such as congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED) and Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD). However, the mechanistic basis of BTR1 activation by alkaline pH, transport activity regulation and pathogenic mutations remains elusive. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of human BTR1 in the outward-facing state in complex with its activating ligands PIP<sub>2</sub> and the inward-facing state with the pathogenic R125H mutation. We reveal that PIP<sub>2</sub> binds at the interface between the transmembrane domain and the N-terminal cytosolic domain of BTR1. Disruption of either the PIP<sub>2</sub> binding site or protonation of PIP<sub>2</sub> phosphate groups by acidic pH can transform BTR1 into an inward-facing conformation. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of how the transport activity and conformation changes of BTR1 are regulated by PIP<sub>2</sub> binding and interaction of TMD and NTD.",

    "abstract": "Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, EC.1.1.127) is an important enzyme engaged in the anaerobic metabolism of cells, catalyzing the conversion of pyruvate to lactate and NADH to NAD+. LDH is a relevant enzyme to investigate structure-function relationships. The present work provides the missing link in our understanding of the evolution of LDHs. This allows to explain (i) the various evolutionary origins of LDHs in eukaryotic cells and their further diversification and (ii) subtle phenotypic modifications with respect to their regulation capacity. We identified a group of cyanobacterial LDHs displaying eukaryotic-like LDH sequence features. The biochemical and structural characterization of Cyanobacterium aponinum LDH, taken as representative, unexpectedly revealed that it displays homotropic and heterotropic activation, typical of an allosteric enzyme, whereas it harbors a long N-terminal extension, a structural feature considered responsible for the lack of allosteric capacity in eukaryotic LDHs. Its crystallographic structure was solved in 2 different configurations typical of the R-active and T-inactive states encountered in allosteric LDHs. Structural comparisons coupled with our evolutionary analyses helped to identify 2 amino acid positions that could have had a major role in the attenuation and extinction of the allosteric activation in eukaryotic LDHs rather than the presence of the N-terminal extension. We tested this hypothesis by site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting C. aponinum LDH mutants displayed reduced allosteric capacity mimicking those encountered in plants and human LDHs. This study provides a new evolutionary scenario of LDHs that unifies descriptions of regulatory properties with structural and mutational patterns of these important enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Human 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) is a key enzyme involved in platelet activation, and the regulation of its activity has been targeted for the treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Despite the clinical importance of 12-LOX, the exact mechanisms by which it affects platelet activation are not fully understood, and the lack of structural information has limited drug discovery efforts. In this study, we used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to determine high-resolution structures (1.7-2.8 \u00c5) of human 12-LOX. Our results showed that 12-LOX can exist in multiple oligomeric states, from monomer to hexamer, which may affect its catalytic activity and membrane association. We also identified different conformations within the 12-LOX dimer, which likely represent different time points in its catalytic cycle. Furthermore, we identified small molecules bound to 12-LOX. The active site of the 12-LOX tetramer was occupied by an endogenous 12-LOX inhibitor, a long-chain acyl coenzyme A. In addition, we found that the 12-LOX hexamer can simultaneously bind to arachidonic acid and ML355, a selective 12-LOX inhibitor that has passed a phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and received a fast-track designation by the Food and Drug Administration. Overall, our findings provide novel insights into the assembly of 12-LOX oligomers, their catalytic mechanism, and small molecule binding, paving the way for further drug development targeting the 12-LOX enzyme.",

Deciphering the functional states of GPCRs induced by various ligands has been one of the primary goals in the field. Here we developed an effective universal method for GPCR cryo-electron microscopy structure determination without the need to prepare GPCR-signaling protein complexes. Using this method, we successfully solved the structures of the \u03b2<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR) bound to antagonistic and agonistic ligands and the adhesion GPCR ADGRL3 in the apo state. For \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR, an intermediate state stabilized by the partial agonist was captured. For ADGRL3, the structure revealed that inactive ADGRL3 adopts a compact fold and that large unusual conformational changes on both the extracellular and intracellular sides are required for activation of adhesion GPCRs. We anticipate that this method will open a new avenue for understanding GPCR structure\u2012function relationships and drug development.",

    "abstract": "The complement system is the first line of innate immune defense against microbial infections. To survive in humans and cause infections, bacterial pathogens have developed sophisticated mechanisms to subvert the complement-mediated bactericidal activity. There are reports that sialidases, also known as neuraminidases, are implicated in bacterial complement resistance; however, its underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. Several complement proteins (e.g., C1q, C4, and C5) and regulators (e.g., factor H and C4bp) are modified by various sialoglycans (glycans with terminal sialic acids), which are essential for their functions. This report provides both functional and structural evidence that bacterial sialidases can disarm the complement system via desialylating key complement proteins and regulators. The oral bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis, a \"keystone\" pathogen of periodontitis, produces a dual domain sialidase (PG0352). Biochemical analyses reveal that PG0352 can desialylate human serum and complement factors and thus protect bacteria from serum killing. Structural analyses show that PG0352 contains a N-terminal carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) and a C-terminal sialidase domain that exhibits a canonical six-bladed \u03b2-propeller sialidase fold with each blade composed of 3-4 antiparallel \u03b2-strands. Follow-up functional studies show that PG0352 forms monomers and is active in a broad range of pH. While PG0352 can remove both N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), it has a higher affinity to Neu5Ac, the most abundant sialic acid in humans. Structural and functional analyses further demonstrate that the CBM binds to carbohydrates and serum glycoproteins. The results shown in this report provide new insights into understanding the role of sialidases in bacterial virulence and open a new avenue to investigate the molecular mechanisms of bacterial complement resistance.",

    "abstract": "The cell walls of pathogenic and acidophilic bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae, contain lipoarabinomannan and arabinogalactan. These components are composed of D-arabinose, the enantiomer of the typical L-arabinose found in plants. The unique glycan structures of mycobacteria contribute to their ability to evade mammalian immune responses. In this study, we identified four enzymes (two GH183 endo-D-arabinanases, GH172 exo-\u03b1-D-arabinofuranosidase, and GH116 exo-\u03b2-D-arabinofuranosidase) from Microbacterium arabinogalactanolyticum. These enzymes completely degraded the complex D-arabinan core structure of lipoarabinomannan and arabinogalactan in a concerted manner. Furthermore, through biochemical characterization using synthetic substrates and X-ray crystallography, we elucidated the mechanisms of substrate recognition and anomer-retaining hydrolysis for the \u03b1- and \u03b2-D-arabinofuranosidic bonds in both endo- and exo-mode reactions. The discovery of these D-arabinan-degrading enzymes, along with the understanding of their structural basis for substrate specificity, provides valuable resources for investigating the intricate glycan architecture of mycobacterial cell wall polysaccharides and their contribution to pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "Reverse transcriptase (RT) is one of three key proteins responsible for the replication cycle of HIV-1 in the host. Several classes of inhibitors have been developed to target the enzyme, with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors forming first-line treatment. Previously, covalent RT inhibitors have been identified and found to bind irreversibly to commonly mutated residues such as Y181C. In this work we aim to circumvent the issue of NNRTI resistance through targeting K102, which has not yet been identified to confer drug resistance. As reported here, 34 compounds were synthesized and characterized biochemically and structurally with wild-type (WT) HIV-1 RT. Two of these inhibitors demonstrate covalent inhibition as evidenced by protein crystallography, enzyme kinetics, mass spectrometry, and antiviral potency in HIV-1 infected human T-cell assays.",

    "abstract": "Understanding and controlling protein motion at atomic resolution is a hallmark challenge for structural biologists and protein engineers because conformational dynamics are essential for complex functions such as enzyme catalysis and allosteric regulation. Time-resolved crystallography offers a window into protein motions, yet without a universal perturbation to initiate conformational changes the method has been limited in scope. Here we couple a solvent-based temperature jump with time-resolved crystallography to visualize structural motions in lysozyme, a dynamic enzyme. We observed widespread atomic vibrations on the nanosecond timescale, which evolve on the submillisecond timescale into localized structural fluctuations that are coupled to the active site. An orthogonal perturbation to the enzyme, inhibitor binding, altered these dynamics by blocking key motions that allow energy to dissipate from vibrations into functional movements linked to the catalytic cycle. Because temperature jump is a universal method for perturbing molecular motion, the method demonstrated here is broadly applicable for studying protein dynamics.",

However, our understanding of their molecular mechanisms is hindered by the lack of structures of enzymatic complexes. Here, we report structures of binary and ternary NGT complexes of Aggregatibacter aphrophilus NGT (AaNGT), revealing an essential dyad of basic/acidic residues located in the N-terminal all \u03b1-domain (AAD) that intimately recognizes the Thr residue within the conserved motif Asn<sup>0</sup>-X<sup>+1</sup>-Ser/Thr<sup>+2</sup>. Poor substrates and inhibitors such as UDP-galactose and UDP-glucose mimetics adopt non-productive conformations, decreasing or impeding catalysis. QM/MM simulations rationalize these results, showing that AaNGT follows a S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction mechanism in which the acceptor asparagine uses its imidic form for catalysis and the UDP-glucose phosphate group acts as a general base. These findings provide key insights into the mechanism of NGTs and will facilitate the design of structure-based inhibitors to treat diseases caused by non-typeable H. influenzae or other Gram-negative bacteria.",

    "abstract": "An increasing number of protein interaction domains and their targets are being found to be intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). The corresponding target recognition mechanisms are mostly elusive because of challenges in performing detailed structural analysis of highly dynamic IDP-IDP complexes. Here, we show that by combining recently developed computational approaches with experiments, the structure of the complex between the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain (CTD) of protein 4.1G and its target IDP region in NuMA can be dissected at high resolution. First, we carry out systematic mutational scanning using dihydrofolate reductase-based protein complementarity analysis to identify essential interaction regions and key residues. The results are found to be highly consistent with an \u03b1/\u03b2-type complex structure predicted by AlphaFold2 (AF2). We then design mutants based on the predicted structure using a deep learning protein sequence design method. The solved crystal structure of one mutant presents the same core structure as predicted by AF2. Further computational prediction and experimental assessment indicate that the well-defined core structure is conserved across complexes of 4.1G CTD with other potential targets. Thus, we reveal that an intrinsically disordered protein interaction domain uses an \u03b1/\u03b2-type structure module formed through synergistic folding to recognize broad IDP targets. Moreover, we show that computational prediction and experiment can be jointly applied to segregate true IDP regions from the core structural domains of IDP-IDP complexes and to uncover the structure-dependent mechanisms of some otherwise elusive IDP-IDP interactions.",

    "abstract": "The development of biocatalysts requires reorganization of the enzyme's active site to facilitate the productive binding of the target substrate and improve turnover number at desired conditions. Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) - dependent transaminases are highly efficient biocatalysts for asymmetric amination of ketones and keto acids. However, transaminases, being stereoselective enzymes, have a narrow substrate specificity due to the ordered structure of the active site and work only in neutral-alkaline media. Here, we investigated the d-amino acid transaminase from Aminobacterium colombiense, with the active site organized differently from that of the canonical d-amino acid transaminase from Bacillus sp. YM-1. Using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, kinetic analysis, molecular modeling, and structural analysis we determined the active site residues responsible for substrate binding, substrate differentiation, thermostability of a functional dimer, and affecting the pH optimum. We demonstrated that the high specificity toward d-glutamate/\u03b1-ketoglutarate is due to the interactions of a \u03b3-carboxylate group with K237 residue, while binding of other substrates stems from the effectiveness of their accommodation in the active site optimized for d-glutamate/\u03b1-ketoglutarate binding. Furthermore, we showed that the K237A substitution shifts the catalytic activity optimum to acidic pH. Our findings are useful for achieving target substrate specificity and demonstrate the potential for developing and optimizing transaminases for various applications.",

    "abstract": "Post-translational modifications with ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls) are regulated by isopeptidases termed deubiquitinases (DUBs) and Ubl proteases. Here, we describe a mild chemical method for the preparation of fluorescence polarization substrates for these enzymes that is based on the activation of C-terminal Ub/Ubl hydrazides to acyl azides and their subsequent functionalization to isopeptides. The procedure is complemented by native purification routes and thus circumvents the previous need for desulfurization and refolding. Its broad applicability was demonstrated by the generation of fully cleavable substrates for Ub, SUMO1, SUMO2, NEDD8, ISG15, and Fubi. We employed these reagents for the investigation of substrate specificities of human UCHL3, USPL1, USP2, USP7, USP16, USP18, and USP36. Pronounced selectivity of USPL1 for SUMO2/3 over SUMO1 was observed, which we rationalize with crystal structures and biochemical assays, revealing a SUMO paralogue specificity mechanism distinct from SENP family deSUMOylases. Moreover, we investigated the recently identified Fubi proteases USP16 and USP36 and found both to act as bona fide deFubiylases, harboring catalytic activity against isopeptide-linked Fubi. Surprisingly, we also noticed the activity of both enzymes toward ISG15, previously not identified in chemoproteomics, which makes USP16 and USP36 the first human DUBs with specific isopeptidase activity toward three distinct modifiers. The methods described here for the preparation of isopeptide-linked, fully folded substrates will aid in the characterization of further DUBs/Ubl proteases. More broadly, our findings highlight possible limitations associated with fluorogenic substrates and Ubl activity-based probes and stress the importance of isopeptide-containing reagents for validating isopeptidase activities and quantifying substrate specificities.",

    "abstract": "In the respiratory chain, NADH oxidation is coupled to ion translocation across the membrane to build up an electrochemical gradient. In the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae, the sodium-pumping NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR) generates a sodium gradient by a so far unknown mechanism. Here we show that ion pumping in Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR is driven by large conformational changes coupling electron transfer to ion translocation. We have determined a series of cryo-EM and X-ray structures of the Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR that represent snapshots of the catalytic cycle. The six subunits NqrA, B, C, D, E, and F of Na<sup>+</sup>-NQR harbor a unique set of cofactors that shuttle the electrons from NADH twice across the membrane to quinone. The redox state of a unique intramembranous [2Fe-2S] cluster orchestrates the movements of subunit NqrC, which acts as an electron transfer switch. We propose that this switching movement controls the release of Na<sup>+</sup> from a binding site localized in subunit NqrB.",

    "abstract": "CAD is a large, 2225 amino acid multienzymatic protein required for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Pathological CAD variants cause a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy which is highly responsive to uridine supplements. CAD deficiency is difficult to diagnose because symptoms are nonspecific, there is no biomarker, and the protein has over 1000 known variants. To improve diagnosis, we assessed the pathogenicity of 20 unreported missense CAD variants using a growth complementation assay that identified 11 pathogenic variants in seven affected individuals; they would benefit from uridine treatment. We also tested nine variants previously reported as pathogenic and confirmed the damaging effect of seven. However, we reclassified two variants as likely benign based on our assay, which is consistent with their long-term follow-up with uridine. We found that several computational methods are unreliable predictors of pathogenic CAD variants, so we extended the functional assay results by studying the impact of pathogenic variants at the protein level. We focused on CAD's dihydroorotase (DHO) domain because it accumulates the largest density of damaging missense changes. The atomic-resolution structures of eight DHO pathogenic variants, combined with functional and molecular dynamics analyses, provided a comprehensive structural and functional understanding of the activity, stability, and oligomerization of CAD's DHO domain. Combining our functional and protein structural analysis can help refine clinical diagnostic workflow for CAD variants in the genomics era.",

The structure of the \"neck\" region, where the DNA-filled capsid is connected to the host-recognizing tail remains poorly understood. We describe cryo-EM structures of the neck, the neck-capsid and neck-tail junctions, and capsid of the Agrobacterium phage Milano. The Milano neck 1 protein connects the 12-fold symmetrical neck to a 5-fold vertex of the icosahedral capsid. Comparison of Milano neck 1 homologs leads to four proposed classes, likely evolved from the simplest one in siphophages to more complex ones in myo- and podophages. Milano neck is surrounded by the atypical collar, which covalently crosslinks the tail sheath to neck 1. The Milano capsid is decorated with three types of proteins, a minor capsid protein (mCP) and two linking proteins crosslinking the mCP to the major capsid protein. The extensive network of disulfide bonds within and between neck, collar, capsid and tail provides an exceptional structural stability to Milano.",

    "abstract": "The Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (NKA) and non-gastric H<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>- ATPase (ngHKA) share ~65\u00a0% sequence identity, and nearly identical catalytic cycles. These pumps alternate between inward-facing (E1) and outward-facing (E2) conformations and differ in their exported substrate (Na<sup>+</sup> or H<sup>+</sup>) and stoichiometries (3 Na<sup>+</sup>:2 K<sup>+</sup> or 1 H<sup>+</sup>:1 K<sup>+</sup>). We reported that structures of the NKA-mimetic ngHKA mutant K794S/A797P/W940/R949C (SPWC) with 2 K<sup>+</sup> occluded in E2-P<sub>i</sub> and 3 Na<sup>+</sup>-bound in E1\u00b7ATP states were nearly identical to NKA structures in equivalent states. Here we report the cryo-EM structures of K794A and K794S, two poorly-selective ngHKA mutants, under conditions to stabilize the E1\u00b7ATP state. Unexpectedly, the structures show a hybrid with both E1- and E2-like structural features. While transmembrane segments TM1-TM3 and TM4's extracellular half adopted an E2-like conformation, the rest of the protein assumed an E1 configuration. Two spherical densities, likely bound Na<sup>+</sup>, were observed at cation-binding sites I and III, without density at site II. This explains the E2-like conformation of TM4's exoplasmic half. In NKA, oxygen atoms derived from the unwound portion of TM4 coordinated Na<sup>+</sup> at site II. Thus, the lack of Na<sup>+</sup> at site II of K794A/S prevents the luminal portion of TM4 from taking an E1-like position. The K794A structure also suggests that incomplete coordination of Na<sup>+</sup> at site III induces the halfway rotation of TM6, which impairs Na<sup>+</sup>-binding at the site II. Thus, our observations provide insight into the molecular mechanism of E2-E1 transition and cooperative Na<sup>+</sup>-binding in the NKA and other related cation pumps.",

In \u03b1-carboxysomes, the disordered linker protein CsoS2 plays an essential role in carboxysome assembly and Rubisco encapsulation. Its mechanism of action, however, is not fully understood. Here we synthetically engineer \u03b1-carboxysome shells using minimal shell components and determine cryoEM structures of these to decipher the principle of shell assembly and encapsulation. The structures reveal that the intrinsically disordered CsoS2 C-terminus is well-structured and acts as a universal \"molecular thread\" stitching through multiple shell protein interfaces. We further uncover in CsoS2 a highly conserved repetitive key interaction motif, [IV]TG, which is critical to the shell assembly and architecture. Our study provides a general mechanism for the CsoS2-governed carboxysome shell assembly and cargo encapsulation and further advances synthetic engineering of carboxysomes for diverse biotechnological applications.",

    "abstract": "The stabilization of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) has emerged as a promising strategy in chemical biology and drug discovery. The identification of suitable starting points for stabilizing native PPIs and their subsequent elaboration into selective and potent molecular glues lacks structure-guided optimization strategies. We have previously identified a disulfide fragment that stabilized the hub protein 14-3-3\u03c3 bound to several of its clients, including ER\u03b1 and C-RAF. Here, we show the structure-based optimization of the nonselective fragment toward selective and highly potent small-molecule stabilizers of the 14-3-3\u03c3/ER\u03b1 complex. The more elaborated molecular glues, for example, show no stabilization of 14-3-3\u03c3/C-RAF up to 150 \u03bcM compound. Orthogonal biophysical assays, including mass spectrometry and fluorescence anisotropy, were used to establish structure-activity relationships. The binding modes of 37 compounds were elucidated with X-ray crystallography, which further assisted the concomitant structure-guided optimization. By targeting specific amino acids in the 14-3-3\u03c3/ER\u03b1 interface and locking the conformation with a spirocycle, the optimized covalent stabilizer <b>181</b> achieved potency, cooperativity, and selectivity similar to the natural product Fusicoccin-A. This case study showcases the value of addressing the structure, kinetics, and cooperativity for molecular glue development.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotics target key biological processes that include protein synthesis. Bacteria respond by developing resistance, which increases rapidly due to antibiotics overuse. Mupirocin, a clinically used natural antibiotic, inhibits isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS), an enzyme that links isoleucine to its tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> for protein synthesis. Two IleRSs, mupirocin-sensitive IleRS1 and resistant IleRS2, coexist in bacteria. The latter may also be found in resistant Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates. Here, we describe the structural basis of mupirocin resistance and unravel a mechanism of hyper-resistance evolved by some IleRS2 proteins. We surprisingly find that an up to 10<sup>3</sup>-fold increase in resistance originates from alteration of the HIGH motif, a signature motif of the class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases to which IleRSs belong. The structural analysis demonstrates how an altered HIGH motif could be adopted in IleRS2 but not IleRS1, providing insight into an elegant mechanism for coevolution of the key catalytic motif and associated antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "N 6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A) is a post-transcriptional modification found uniquely at position 37 of tRNAs that decipher ANN-codons in the three domains of life. tRNA t6A plays a pivotal role in promoting translational fidelity and maintaining protein homeostasis. The biosynthesis of tRNA t6A requires members from two evolutionarily conserved protein families TsaC/Sua5 and TsaD/Kae1/Qri7, and a varying number of auxiliary proteins. Furthermore, tRNA t6A is modified into a cyclic hydantoin form of t6A (ct6A) by TcdA in bacteria. In this work, we have identified a TsaD-TsaC-SUA5-TcdA modular protein (TsaN) from Pandoraviruses and determined a 3.2 \u00c5 resolution cryo-EM structure of P. salinus TsaN. The four domains of TsaN share strong structural similarities with TsaD/Kae1/Qri7 proteins, TsaC/Sua5 proteins, and Escherichia coli TcdA. TsaN catalyzes the formation of threonylcarbamoyladenylate (TC-AMP) using L-threonine, HCO3- and ATP, but does not participate further in tRNA t6A biosynthesis. We report for the first time that TsaN catalyzes a tRNA-independent threonylcarbamoyl modification of adenosine phosphates, leading to t6ADP and t6ATP. Moreover, TsaN is also active in catalyzing tRNA-independent conversion of t6A nucleoside to ct6A. Our results imply that TsaN from Pandoraviruses might be a prototype of the tRNA t6A- and ct6A-modifying enzymes in some cellular organisms.",

    "abstract": "Strigolactones (SLs) play fundamental roles in regulating plant architecture, which is a major factor determining crop yield. The perception and signal transduction of SLs require the formation of a complex containing the receptor DWARF14 (D14), an F-box protein D3 and a transcriptional regulator D53 in an SL-dependent manner. Structural and biochemical analyses of D14 and its orthologs DAD2 and AtD14, D3 and the complexes of ASK1-D3-AtD14 and D3CTH-D14 have made great contributions to understanding the mechanisms of SL perception. However, structural analyses of D53 and the D53-D3-D14 holo-complex are challenging, and the biochemical mechanism underlying the complex assembly remains poorly understood. Here, we found that apo-D53 was rather flexible and reconstituted the holo-complex containing D53, S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (SKP1), D3 and D14 with rac-GR24. The cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of SKP1-D3-D14 in the presence of D53 was analyzed and superimposed on the crystal structure of ASK1-D3-AtD14 without D53. No large conformational rearrangement was observed, but a 9\u00c5 rotation appeared between D14 and AtD14. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange monitored by mass spectrometry, we analyzed dynamic motifs of D14, D3 and D53 in the D53-SKP1-D3-D14 complex assembly process and further identified two potential interfaces in D53 that are located in the N and D2 domains, respectively. Together, our results uncovered the dynamic conformational changes and built a model of the holo-complex D53-SKP1-D3-D14, offering valuable information for the biochemical and genetic mechanisms of SL perception and signal transduction.",

Whereas its C-terminal domain (CTD) structure is well resolved, there is an open debate regarding the conformation adopted by the NTD as it is predicted as disordered but found in a variety of complex-dependent conformations or missing from many other structures. Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that the SARS CoV-2 Nsp8 NTD features both well folded secondary structure and disordered segments. Our results suggest that while part of this domain corresponding to two long \u03b1-helices forms autonomously, the folding of other segments would require interaction with other replicase components. When isolated, the \u03b1-helix population progressively declines towards the C-termini but surprisingly binds dsRNA while preserving structural disorder.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic arginine noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) are found in several actinobacterial peptide natural products with therapeutically useful antibacterial properties. The preparation of ncAAs like enduracididine and capreomycidine currently takes multiple biosynthetic or chemosynthetic steps, thus limiting the commercial availability and applicability of these cyclic guanidine-containing amino acids. We recently discovered and characterized the biosynthetic pathway of guanitoxin, a potent freshwater cyanobacterial neurotoxin, that contains an arginine-derived cyclic guanidine phosphate within its highly polar structure. The ncAA l-enduracididine is an early intermediate in guanitoxin biosynthesis and is produced by GntC, a unique pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme. GntC catalyzes a cyclodehydration from a stereoselectively \u03b3-hydroxylated l-arginine precursor via a reaction that functionally and mechanistically diverges from previously established actinobacterial cyclic arginine ncAA pathways. Herein, we interrogate l-enduracididine biosynthesis from the cyanobacterium <i>Sphaerospermopsis torques-reginae</i> ITEP-024 using spectroscopy, stable isotope labeling techniques, and X-ray crystallography structure-guided site-directed mutagenesis. GntC initially facilitates the reversible deprotonations of the \u03b1- and \u03b2-positions of its substrate before catalyzing an irreversible diastereoselective dehydration and subsequent intramolecular cyclization. The comparison of <i>holo</i>- and substrate-bound GntC structures and activity assays on site-specific mutants further identified amino acid residues that contribute to the overall catalytic mechanism. These interdisciplinary efforts at structurally and functionally characterizing GntC enable an improved understanding of how nature divergently produces cyclic arginine ncAAs and generate additional tools for their biocatalytic production and downstream biological applications.",

    "abstract": "Human APOBEC3 (A3) cytidine deaminases are antiviral factors that are particularly potent against retroviruses. As a countermeasure, HIV-1 uses a viral infectivity factor (Vif) to target specific human A3s for proteasomal degradation. Vif recruits cellular transcription cofactor CBF-\u03b2 and Cullin-5 (CUL5) RING E3 ubiquitin ligase to bind different A3s distinctively, but how this is accomplished remains unclear in the absence of the atomic structure of the complex. Here, we present the cryo-EM structures of HIV-1 Vif in complex with human A3H, CBF-\u03b2 and components of CUL5 ubiquitin ligase (CUL5, ELOB, and ELOC). Vif nucleates the entire complex by directly binding four human proteins, A3H, CBF-\u03b2, CUL5, and ELOC. The structures reveal a large interface area between A3H and Vif, primarily mediated by an \u03b1-helical side of A3H and a five-stranded \u03b2-sheet of Vif. This A3H-Vif interface unveils the basis for sensitivity-modulating polymorphism of both proteins, including a previously reported gain-of-function mutation in Vif isolated from HIV/AIDS patients. Our structural and functional results provide insights into the remarkable interplay between HIV and humans and would inform development efforts for anti-HIV therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Great effort has been devoted to discovering the basis of A3G-Vif interaction, the key event of HIV's counteraction mechanism to evade antiviral innate immune response. Here we show reconstitution of the A3G-Vif complex and subsequent A3G ubiquitination in vitro and report the cryo-EM structure of the A3G-Vif complex at 2.8\u2009\u00c5 resolution using solubility-enhanced variants of A3G and Vif. We present an atomic model of the A3G-Vif interface, which assembles via known amino acid determinants. This assembly is not achieved by protein-protein interaction alone, but also involves RNA. The cryo-EM structure and in vitro ubiquitination assays identify an adenine/guanine base preference for the interaction and a unique Vif-ribose contact. This establishes the biological significance of an RNA ligand. Further assessment of interactions between A3G, Vif, and RNA ligands show that the A3G-Vif assembly and subsequent ubiquitination can be controlled by amino acid mutations at the interface or by polynucleotide modification, suggesting that a specific chemical moiety would be a promising pharmacophore to inhibit the A3G-Vif interaction.",

    "abstract": "Hydroxysteroid 17-beta-dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) is a hepatic lipid droplet-associated enzyme that is upregulated in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Recently, there have been several reports that predicted loss of function variants in HSD17B13 protect against the progression of steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Here we report crystal structures of full length HSD17B13 in complex with its NAD<sup>+</sup> cofactor, and with lipid/detergent molecules and small molecule inhibitors from two distinct series in the ligand binding pocket. These structures provide insights into a mechanism for lipid droplet-associated proteins anchoring to membranes as well as a basis for HSD17B13 variants disrupting function. Two series of inhibitors interact with the active site residues and the bound cofactor similarly, yet they occupy different paths leading to the active site. These structures provide ideas for structure-based design of inhibitors that may be used in the treatment of liver disease.",

    "abstract": "In red-light sensing phytochromes, isomerization of the bilin chromophore triggers structural and dynamic changes across multiple domains, ultimately leading to control of the output module (OPM) activity. In between, a hairpin structure, \"arm\", extends from an interconnecting domain to the chromophore region. Here, by removing this protein segment in a bacteriophytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans (DrBphP), we show that the arm is crucial for signal transduction. Crystallographic, spectroscopic, and biochemical data indicate that this variant maintains the properties of DrBphP in the resting state. Spectroscopic data also reveal that the armless systems maintain the ability to respond to light. However, there is no subsequent regulation of OPM activity without the arms. Thermal denaturation reveals that\u00a0the arms stabilize the DrBphP structure. Our results underline the importance of the structurally flexible interconnecting hairpin extensions and describe their central role in the allosteric coupling of phytochromes.",

The final enzyme in the BLP synthesis pathway is the apolipoprotein <i>N</i>-acyltransferase, Lnt, which is proposed to act by a ping-pong mechanism. Here, we use x-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy to chart the structural changes undergone during the progress of the enzyme through the reaction. We identify a single active site that has evolved to bind, individually and sequentially, substrates that satisfy structural and chemical criteria to position reactive parts next to the catalytic triad for reaction. This study validates the ping-pong mechanism, explains the molecular bases for Lnt's substrate promiscuity, and should facilitate the design of antibiotics with minimal off-target effects.",

    "abstract": "Selective orthosteric inhibition of kinases has been challenging due to the conserved active site architecture of kinases and emergence of resistance mutants. Simultaneous inhibition of distant orthosteric and allosteric sites, which we refer to as \"double-drugging\", has recently been shown to be effective in overcoming drug resistance. However, detailed biophysical characterization of the cooperative nature between orthosteric and allosteric modulators has not been undertaken. Here, we provide a quantitative framework for double-drugging of kinases employing isothermal titration calorimetry, F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer, coupled-enzyme assays, and X-ray crystallography. We discern positive and negative cooperativity for Aurora A kinase (AurA) and Abelson kinase (Abl) with different combinations of orthosteric and allosteric modulators. We find that a conformational equilibrium shift is the main principle governing cooperativity. Notably, for both kinases, we find a synergistic decrease of the required orthosteric and allosteric drug dosages when used in combination to inhibit kinase activities to clinically relevant inhibition levels. X-ray crystal structures of the double-drugged kinase complexes reveal the molecular principles underlying the cooperative nature of double-drugging AurA and Abl with orthosteric and allosteric inhibitors. Finally, we observe a fully closed conformation of Abl when bound to a pair of positively cooperative orthosteric and allosteric modulators, shedding light on the puzzling abnormality of previously solved closed Abl structures. Collectively, our data provide mechanistic and structural insights into rational design and evaluation of double-drugging strategies.",

Here, we describe the development of an efficient method for the asymmetric synthesis of L-ABA in a tri-enzymatic cascade in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) using a cost-effective L-Thr. Low activity of leucine dehydrogenase from Bacillus thuringiensis (BtLDH) and unbalanced expression of enzymes in the cascade were major challenges. Mechanism-based protein engineering generated the optimal triple variant BtLDH<sup>M3</sup> (A262S/V296C/P150M) with 20.7-fold increased specific activity and 9.6-fold increased k<sub>cat</sub> /K<sub>m</sub> compared with the wild type. Optimizing plasmids with different copy numbers regulated enzymatic expression, thereby increasing the activity ratio (0.3\u2009:\u20091:0.6) of these enzymes in\u2005vivo close to the optimal ratio (0.4\u2009:\u20091\u2009:\u20091) in\u2005vitro. Importing the optimal triple mutant BtLDH<sup>M3</sup> into our constructed pathway in\u2005vivo and optimization of transformation conditions achieved one-pot conversion of L-Thr to 130.2\u2005g/L L-ABA, with 95\u2009% conversion, 99\u2009% e.e. and 10.9\u2005g\u2009L<sup>-1</sup> \u2009h<sup>-1</sup> productivity (the highest to date) in 12\u2005h on a 500\u2005mL scale.

    "abstract": "Branched chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic impairments have been implicated in several diseases. Branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) controls the rate limiting step in BCAA degradation, the activity of which is inhibited by BCKDH kinase (BDK)-mediated phosphorylation. Screening efforts to discover BDK inhibitors led to identification of thiophene PF-07208254, which improved cardiometabolic endpoints in mice. Structure-activity relationship studies led to identification of a thiazole series of BDK inhibitors; however, these inhibitors did not improve metabolism in mice upon chronic administration. While the thiophenes demonstrated sustained branched chain ketoacid (BCKA) lowering and reduced BDK protein levels, the thiazoles increased BCKAs and BDK protein levels. Thiazoles increased BDK proximity to BCKDH-E2, whereas thiophenes reduced BDK proximity to BCKDH-E2, which may promote BDK degradation. Thus, we describe two BDK inhibitor series that possess differing attributes regarding BDK degradation or stabilization and provide a mechanistic understanding of the desirable features of an effective BDK inhibitor.",

    "abstract": "Members of the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) family are found in all domains of life and are involved in processes ranging from protein synthesis and gene expression to detoxification and virulence. Due to the variety of their macromolecular targets, GNATs are a highly diverse family of proteins. Currently, 3D structures of only a small number of GNAT representatives are available and thus the family remains poorly characterized. Here, the crystal structure of the guanidine riboswitch-associated GNAT from Lactobacillus curiae (LcGNAT) that acetylates canavanine, a structural analogue of arginine with antimetabolite properties, is reported. LcGNAT shares the conserved fold of the members of the GNAT superfamily, but does not contain an N-terminal \u03b20 strand and instead contains a C-terminal \u03b27 strand. Its P-loop, which coordinates the pyrophosphate moiety of the acetyl-coenzyme A cosubstrate, is degenerated. These features are shared with its closest homologues in the polyamine acetyltransferase subclass. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed a central role of the conserved residue Tyr142 in catalysis, as well as the semi-conserved Tyr97 and Glu92, suggesting that despite its individual substrate specificity LcGNAT performs the classical reaction mechanism of this family.",

Here, we provide high-resolution functional snapshots of type IV-A Csf complexes before and after target dsDNA binding, either in the absence or presence of CasDinG, revealing the mechanisms underlying Csf<sup>crRNA</sup> complex assembly, \"DWN\" PAM-dependent dsDNA targeting, R-loop formation, and CasDinG recruitment. Furthermore, we establish that CasDinG, a signature DinG family helicase, harbors ssDNA-stimulated ATPase activity and ATP-dependent 5'-3' DNA helicase activity. In addition, we show that CasDinG unwinds the non-target strand (NTS) and target strand (TS) of target dsDNA from the Csf<sup>crRNA</sup> complex. These molecular details advance our mechanistic understanding of type IV-A CRISPR-Csf function and should enable Csf complexes to be harnessed as genome-engineering tools for biotechnological applications.",

    "abstract": "The ribosome is a major target for clinically used antibiotics, but multidrug resistant pathogenic bacteria are making our current arsenal of antimicrobials obsolete. Here we present cryo-electron-microscopy structures of 17 distinct compounds from six different antibiotic classes bound to the bacterial ribosome at resolutions ranging from 1.6 to 2.2\u2009\u00c5. The improved resolution enables a precise description of antibiotic-ribosome interactions, encompassing solvent networks that mediate multiple additional interactions between the drugs and their target. Our results reveal a high structural conservation in the binding mode between antibiotics with the same scaffold, including ordered water molecules. Water molecules are visualized within the antibiotic binding sites that are preordered, become ordered in the presence of the drug and that are physically displaced on drug binding. Insight into RNA-ligand interactions will facilitate development of new antimicrobial agents, as well as other RNA-targeting therapies.",

    "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and glucagon receptor (GCGR), two members of class B1 G protein-coupled receptors, play important roles in glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism. They share a high degree of sequence homology but have different functionalities. Unimolecular dual agonists of both receptors developed recently displayed better clinical efficacies than that of monotherapy. To study the underlying molecular mechanisms, we determined high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of GLP-1R or GCGR in complex with heterotrimeric G<sub>s</sub> protein and three GLP-1R/GCGR dual agonists including peptide 15, MEDI0382 (cotadutide) and SAR425899 with variable activating profiles at GLP-1R versus GCGR. Compared with related structures reported previously and supported by our published pharmacological data, key residues responsible for ligand recognition and dual agonism were identified. Analyses of peptide conformational features revealed a difference in side chain orientations within the first three residues, indicating that distinct engagements in the deep binding pocket are required to achieve receptor selectivity. The middle region recognizes extracellular loop 1 (ECL1), ECL2, and the top of transmembrane helix 1 (TM1) resulting in specific conformational changes of both ligand and receptor, especially the dual agonists reshaped ECL1 conformation of GLP-1R relative to that of GCGR, suggesting an important role of ECL1 interaction in executing dual agonism. Structural investigation of lipid modification showed a better interaction between lipid moiety of MEDI0382 and TM1-TM2 cleft, in line with its increased potency at GCGR than SAR425899. Together, the results provide insightful information for the design and development of improved therapeutics targeting these two receptors simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "Molecular glue degraders are an effective therapeutic modality, but their design principles are not well understood. Recently, several unexpectedly diverse compounds were reported to deplete cyclin K by linking CDK12-cyclin K to the DDB1-CUL4-RBX1 E3 ligase. Here, to investigate how chemically dissimilar small molecules trigger cyclin K degradation, we evaluated 91 candidate degraders in structural, biophysical and cellular studies and reveal all compounds acquire glue activity via simultaneous CDK12 binding and engagement of DDB1 interfacial residues, in particular Arg928. While we identify multiple published kinase inhibitors as cryptic degraders, we also show that these glues do not require pronounced inhibitory properties for activity and that the relative degree of CDK12 inhibition versus cyclin K degradation is tuneable. We further demonstrate cyclin K degraders have transcriptional signatures distinct from CDK12 inhibitors, thereby offering unique therapeutic opportunities. The systematic structure-activity relationship analysis presented herein provides a conceptual framework for rational molecular glue design.",

    "abstract": "Titin is the largest protein found in nature and spans half a sarcomere in vertebrate striated muscle. The protein has multiple functions, including in the organisation of the thick filament and acting as a molecular spring during the muscle contraction cycle. Missense variants in titin have been linked to both cardiac and skeletal myopathies. Titin is primarily composed of tandem repeats of immunoglobulin and fibronectin type III (Fn3) domains in a variety of repeat patterns; however, the vast majority of these domains have not had their high-resolution structure determined experimentally. Here, we present the crystal structures of seven wild type titin Fn3 domains and two harbouring rare missense variants reported in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients. All domains present the typical Fn3 fold, with the domains harbouring variants reported in HCM patients retaining the wild-type conformation. The effect on domain folding and stability were assessed for five rare missense variants found in HCM patients: four caused thermal destabilization of between 7 and 13\u00a0\u00b0C and one prevented the folding of its domain. The structures also allowed us to locate the positions of residues whose mutations have been linked to congenital myopathies and rationalise how they convey their deleterious effects. We find no evidence of physiological homodimer formation, excluding one hypothesised mechanism as to how titin variants could exert pathological effects.",

    "abstract": "Leptospiral immunoglobulin-like (Lig) protein family is a surface-exposed protein from the pathogenic Leptospira. The Lig protein family has been identified as an essential virulence factor of L. interrogan. One of the family members, LigA, contains 13 homologous tandem repeats of bacterial Ig-like (Big) domains in its extracellular portion. It is crucial in binding with the host's Extracellular matrices (ECM) and complement factors. However, its vital role in the invasion and evasion of pathogenic Leptospira, structural details, and domain organization of the extracellular portion of this protein are not explored thoroughly. Here, we described the first high-resolution crystal structure of a variable region segment (LigA8-9) of LigA at 1.87\u00a0\u00c5 resolution. The structure showed some remarkably distinctive aspects compared with other closely related Immunoglobulin domains. The structure illustrated the relative orientation of two domains and highlighted the role of the linker region in the domain orientation. We also observed an apparent electron density of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions coordinated with a proper interacting geometry within the protein. Molecular dynamic simulations demonstrated the involvement of a linker salt bridge in providing rigidity between the two domains. Our study proposes an overall arrangement of Ig-like domains in the LigA protein. The structural understanding of the extracellular portion of LigA and its interaction with the ECM provides insight into developing new therapeutics directed toward leptospirosis.",

    "abstract": "Mannose 2-epimerase (ME), a member of the acylglucosamine 2-epimerase (AGE) superfamily that catalyzes epimerization of D-mannose and D-glucose, has recently been characterized to have potential for D-mannose production. However, the substrate-recognition and catalytic mechanism of ME remains unknown. In this study, structures of Runella slithyformis ME (RsME) and its D254A mutant [RsME(D254A)] were determined in their apo forms and as\u00a0intermediate-analog complexes [RsME-D-glucitol and RsME(D254A)-D-glucitol]. RsME possesses the (\u03b1/\u03b1)<sub>6</sub>-barrel of the AGE superfamily members but has a unique pocket-covering long loop (loop<sub>\u03b17-\u03b18</sub>). The RsME-D-glucitol structure showed that loop<sub>\u03b17-\u03b18</sub> moves towards D-glucitol and closes the active pocket. Trp251 and Asp254 in loop<sub>\u03b17-\u03b18</sub> are only conserved in MEs and interact with D-glucitol. Kinetic analyses of the mutants confirmed the importance of these residues for RsME activity. Moreover, the structures of RsME(D254A) and RsME(D254A)-D-glucitol revealed that Asp254 is vital for binding the ligand in a correct conformation and for active-pocket closure. Docking calculations and structural comparison with other 2-epimerases show that the longer loop<sub>\u03b17-\u03b18</sub> in RsME causes steric hindrance upon binding to disaccharides. A detailed substrate-recognition and catalytic mechanism for monosaccharide-specific epimerization in RsME has been proposed.",

    "abstract": "Terpenoids account for more than 60% of all natural products, and their carbon skeletons originate from common isoprenoid units of different lengths such as geranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate. Here we characterize a metal-dependent, bifunctional isoprenyl diphosphate synthase from the leaf beetle Phaedon cochleariae by structural and functional analyses. Inter- and intramolecular cooperative effects in the homodimer strongly depend on the provided metal ions and regulate the biosynthetic flux of terpene precursors to either biological defence or physiological development. Strikingly, a unique chain length determination domain adapts to form geranyl or farnesyl pyrophosphate by altering enzyme symmetry and ligand affinity between both subunits. In addition, we identify an allosteric geranyl-pyrophosphate-specific binding site that shares similarity with end-product inhibition in human farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase. Our combined findings elucidate a deeply intertwined reaction mechanism in the P. cochleariae isoprenyl diphosphate synthase that integrates substrate, product and metal-ion concentrations to harness its dynamic potential.",

Three cognate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) subtypes (PPAR\u03b1/\u03b4/\u03b3) are considered as attractive targets. Although lanifibranor (PPAR\u03b1/\u03b4/\u03b3 pan agonist) and saroglitazar (PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3 dual agonist) are currently under investigation in clinical trials for NASH, the development of seladelpar (PPAR\u03b4-selective agonist), elafibranor (PPAR\u03b1/\u03b4 dual agonist), and many other dual/pan agonists has been discontinued due to serious side effects or little/no efficacies. This study aimed to obtain functional and structural insights into the potency, efficacy, and selectivity against PPAR\u03b1/\u03b4/\u03b3 of three current and past anti-NASH investigational drugs: lanifibranor, seladelpar, and elafibranor. Ligand activities were evaluated by three assays to detect different facets of the PPAR activation: transactivation assay, coactivator recruitment assay, and thermal stability assay. Seven high-resolution cocrystal structures (namely, those of the PPAR\u03b1/\u03b4/\u03b3-ligand-binding domain (LBD)-lanifibranor, PPAR\u03b1/\u03b4/\u03b3-LBD-seladelpar, and PPAR\u03b1-LBD-elafibranor) were obtained through X-ray diffraction analyses, six of which represent the first deposit in the Protein Data Bank. Lanifibranor and seladelpar were found to bind to different regions of the PPAR\u03b1/\u03b4/\u03b3-ligand-binding pockets and activated all PPAR subtypes with different potencies and efficacies in the three assays. In contrast, elafibranor induced transactivation and coactivator recruitment (not thermal stability) of all PPAR subtypes, but the PPAR\u03b4/\u03b3-LBD-elafibranor cocrystals were not obtained. These results illustrate the highly variable PPAR\u03b1/\u03b4/\u03b3 activation profiles and binding modes of these PPAR ligands that define their pharmacological actions.",

The unpredictability has frustrated rational design efforts to enhance plant Rubisco towards the prized growth-enhancing carboxylation properties of red algae Griffithsia monilis GmRubisco. To address this, we determined the crystal structure of GmRubisco to 1.7\u2009\u00c5. Three structurally divergent domains were identified relative to the red-type bacterial Rhodobacter sphaeroides RsRubisco that, unlike GmRubisco, are expressed in Escherichia coli and plants. Kinetic comparison of 11 RsRubisco chimaeras revealed that incorporating C329A and A332V substitutions from GmRubisco Loop 6 (corresponding to plant residues 328 and 331) into RsRubisco increased the carboxylation rate (k<sub>cat</sub><sup>c</sup>) by 60%, the carboxylation efficiency in air by 22% and the CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> specificity (S<sub>c/o</sub>) by 7%. Plastome transformation of this RsRubisco Loop 6 mutant into tobacco enhanced photosynthesis and growth up to twofold over tobacco producing wild-type RsRubisco. Our findings demonstrate the utility of RsRubisco for the identification and in planta testing of amino acid grafts from algal Rubisco that can enhance the enzyme's carboxylase potential.",

    "abstract": "Bacteroidetes are abundant members of the human microbiota, utilizing a myriad of diet- and host-derived glycans in the distal gut<sup>1</sup>. Glycan uptake across the bacterial outer membrane of these bacteria is mediated by SusCD protein complexes, comprising a membrane-embedded barrel and a lipoprotein lid, which is thought to open and close to facilitate substrate binding and transport. However, surface-exposed glycan-binding proteins and glycoside hydrolases also play critical roles in the capture, processing and transport of large glycan chains. The interactions between these components in the outer membrane are poorly understood, despite being crucial for nutrient acquisition by our colonic microbiota. Here we show that for both the levan and dextran utilization systems of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, the additional outer membrane components assemble on the core SusCD transporter, forming stable glycan-utilizing machines that we term utilisomes. Single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy structures in the absence and presence of substrate reveal concerted conformational changes that demonstrate the mechanism of substrate capture, and rationalize the role of each component in the utilisome.",

    "abstract": "Members of the 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT) subgroup in the tautomerase superfamily (TSF) are constructed from a single \u03b2-\u03b1-\u03b2 unit and form homo- or heterohexamers, whereas those of the other four subgroups are composed of two consecutively joined \u03b2-\u03b1-\u03b2 units and form trimers. A subset of sequences, double the length of the short 4-OTs, is found in the 4-OT subgroup. These \"fused\" 4-OTs form a separate subgroup that connects to the short 4-OTs in a sequence similarity network (SSN). The fused gene can be a template for the other four subgroups, resulting in the diversification of activity. Analysis of the SSN shows that multiple nodes in the fused 4-OTs connect to five linker nodes, which in turn connect to the short 4-OTs. Some fused 4-OTs are symmetric trimers and others are asymmetric trimers. The origin of this asymmetry was investigated by subjecting the sequences in three linker nodes and a closely associated fourth node to kinetic, mutagenic, and structural analyses. The results show that each sequence corresponds to the \u03b1- or \u03b2-subunit of a heterohexamer that functions as a 4-OT. Mutagenesis indicates that the key residues in both are \u03b1Pro1 and \u03b2Arg-11, like that of a typical 4-OT. Crystallographic analysis shows that both heterohexamers are asymmetric, where one heterodimer is flipped 180\u00b0 relative to the other two heterodimers. The fusion of two subunits (\u03b1 and \u03b2) of one asymmetric heterohexamer generates an asymmetric trimer with 4-OT activity. Hence, asymmetry can be introduced at the heterohexamer level and then retained in the fused trimers.",

    "abstract": "Tryptophan is frequently found on the surface of membrane-associated proteins that interact with the lipid membrane. However, because of their multifaceted interactions, it is difficult to pinpoint the structure-activity relationship of each tryptophan residue. Here, we describe the use of racemic protein crystallography to probe dedicated tryptophan interactions of a model tryptophan-rich bacteriocin aureocin A53 (AucA) by inclusion and/or exclusion of potential ligands. In the presence of tetrahedral anions that are isosteric to the head group of phospholipids, distinct tryptophan H-bond networks were revealed. H-bond donation by W40 was critical for antibacterial activity, as its substitution by 1-methyltryptophan resulted in substantial loss of activity against bacterial clinical isolates. Meanwhile, exclusion of tetrahedral ions revealed that W3 partakes in formation of a dimeric interface, thus suggesting that AucA is dimeric in solution and dissociated to interact with the phosphate head group in the presence of the lipid membrane. Based on these findings, we could predict the tryptophan residue responsible for activity as well as the oligomeric state of a distant homologue lacticin Q (48%).",

In most cases, early detection and/or treatment correlates with an increased chance of survival. This study, has identified and characterised a highly specific anti-HER2 single-domain antibody (sdAb), NM-02, as a potential theranostic tool. Complete structural description by X-ray crystallography has revealed a non-overlapping epitope with current anti-HER2 antibodies. To reduce the immunogenicity risk, NM-02 underwent a humanisation process and retained wild type-like binding properties. To further de-risk the progression towards chemistry, manufacturing and control (CMC) we performed full developability profiling revealing favourable thermal and physical biochemical 'drug-like' properties. Finally, the application of the lead humanised NM-02 candidate (variant K) for HER2-specific imaging purposes was demonstrated using breast cancer HER2+/BT474 xenograft mice.",

    "abstract": "Chemokines are key regulators of leukocyte trafficking and attractive targets for anti-inflammatory therapy. Evasins are chemokine-binding proteins from tick saliva, whose application as anti-inflammatory therapeutics will require manipulation of their chemokine target selectivity. Here we describe subclass A3 evasins, which are unique to the tick genus Amblyomma and distinguished from \"classical\" class A1 evasins by an additional disulfide bond near the chemokine recognition interface. The A3 evasin EVA-AAM1001 (EVA-A) bound to CC chemokines and inhibited their receptor activation. Unlike A1 evasins, EVA-A was not highly dependent on N- and C-terminal regions to differentiate chemokine targets. Structures of chemokine-bound EVA-A revealed a deep hydrophobic pocket, unique to A3 evasins, that interacts with the residue immediately following the CC motif of the chemokine. Mutations to this pocket altered the chemokine selectivity of EVA-A. Thus, class A3 evasins provide a suitable platform for engineering proteins with applications in research, diagnosis or anti-inflammatory therapy.",

    "abstract": "Membrane disruptive \u03b1-helical antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) offer an opportunity to address multidrug resistance; however, most AMPs are toxic and unstable in serum. These limitations can be partly overcome by introducing D-residues, which often confers protease resistance and reduces toxicity without affecting antibacterial activity, presumably due to lowered \u03b1-helicity. Here, we investigated 31 diastereomers of the \u03b1-helical AMP KKLLKLLKLLL. Three diastereomers containing two, three, and four D-residues showed increased antibacterial effects, comparable hemolysis, reduced toxicity against HEK293 cells, and excellent serum stability, while another diastereomer with four D-residues additionally displayed lower hemolysis. X-ray crystallography confirmed that high or low \u03b1-helicity as measured by circular dichroism indicated \u03b1-helical or disordered structures independently of the number of chirality switched residues. In contrast to previous reports, \u03b1-helicity across diastereomers correlated with both antibacterial activity and hemolysis and revealed a complex relationship between stereochemistry, activity, and toxicity, highlighting the potential of diastereomers for property optimization.",

Tissue specific post-translational modifications of cytochrome c (Cytc) are involved in ischemia-reperfusion injury by regulating mitochondrial respiration and apoptosis. Here, we describe an acetylation site of Cytc, lysine 39 (K39), which was mapped in ischemic porcine skeletal muscle and removed by sirtuin5 in vitro. Using purified protein and cellular double knockout models, we show that K39 acetylation and acetylmimetic K39Q replacement increases cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity and ROS scavenging while inhibiting apoptosis via decreased binding to Apaf-1, caspase cleavage and activity, and cardiolipin peroxidase activity. These results are discussed with X-ray crystallography structures of K39 acetylated (1.50 \u00c5) and acetylmimetic K39Q Cytc (1.36 \u00c5) and NMR dynamics. We propose that K39 acetylation is an adaptive response that controls electron transport chain flux, allowing skeletal muscle to meet heightened energy demand while simultaneously providing the tissue with robust resilience to ischemia-reperfusion injury.",

    "abstract": "The formation of amyloid filaments through templated seeding is believed to underlie the propagation of pathology in most human neurodegenerative diseases. A widely used model system to study this process is to seed amyloid filament formation in cultured cells using human brain extracts. Here, we report the electron cryo-microscopy structures of tau filaments from\u00a0\u00a0undifferentiated seeded SH-SY5Y cells that transiently expressed N-terminally HA-tagged 1N3R or 1N4R human tau, using brain extracts from individuals with Alzheimer's disease or corticobasal degeneration. Although the resulting filament structures differed from those of the brain seeds, some degrees of structural templating were observed. Studying templated seeding in cultured cells, and determining the structures of the resulting filaments, can thus provide insights into the cellular aspects underlying neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "High-precision nanomaterials to entrap DNA-binding molecules are sought after for applications such as controlled drug delivery and scaffold-assisted structural biology. Here, we engineered protein-DNA cocrystals to serve as scaffolds for DNA-binding molecules. The designed cocrystals, isoreticular cocrystals, contain DNA-binding protein and cognate DNA blocks where the DNA-DNA junctions stack end-to-end. Furthermore, the crystal symmetry allows topology preserving (isoreticular) expansion of the DNA stack without breaking protein-protein contacts, hence providing larger solvent channels for guest diffusion. Experimentally, the resulting designed isoreticular cocrystal adopted an interpenetrating <i>I</i>222 lattice, a phenomenon previously observed in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The interpenetrating lattice crystallized dependably in the same space group despite myriad modifications at the DNA-DNA junctions. Assembly was modular with respect to the DNA inserted for expansion, providing an interchangeable DNA sequence for guest-specified scaffolding. Also, the DNA-DNA junctions were tunable, accommodating varied sticky base overhang lengths and terminal phosphorylation. As a proof of concept, we used the interpenetrating scaffold crystals to separately entrap three distinct guest molecules during crystallization. Isoreticular cocrystal design offers a route to a programmable scaffold for DNA-binding molecules, and the design principles may be applied to existing cocrystals to develop scaffolding materials.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) is structurally dynamic and has been observed by cryo-EM to adopt a variety of prefusion conformations that can be categorized as locked, closed, and open. S-trimers adopting locked conformations are tightly packed featuring structural elements incompatible with RBD in the \"up\" position. For SARS-CoV-2 S, it has been shown that the locked conformations are transient under neutral pH. Probably because of their transience, locked conformations remain largely uncharacterized for SARS-CoV-1 S. In this study, we introduced x1, x2, and x3 disulfides into SARS-CoV-1 S. Some of these disulfides have been shown to preserve rare locked conformations when introduced to SARS-CoV-2 S. Introduction of these disulfides allowed us to image a variety of locked and other rare conformations for SARS-CoV-1 S by cryo-EM. We identified bound cofactors and structural features that are associated with SARS-CoV-1 S locked conformations. We compare newly determined structures with other available spike structures of SARS-related CoVs to identify conserved features and discuss their possible functions.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial lytic transglycosylases (LTs) contribute to peptidoglycan cell wall metabolism and are potential drug targets to potentiate \u03b2-lactam antibiotics to overcome antibiotic resistance. Since LT inhibitor development is underexplored, we probed 15 N-acetyl-containing heterocycles in a structure-guided fashion for their ability to inhibit and bind to the Campylobacter jejuni LT Cj0843c. Ten GlcNAc analogs were synthesized with substitutions at the C1 position, with two having an additional modification at the C4 or C6 position. Most of the compounds showed weak inhibition of Cj0843c activity. Compounds with alterations at the C4 position, replacing the -OH with a -NH<sub>2</sub> , and C6 position, the addition of a -CH<sub>3</sub> , yielded improved inhibitory efficacy. All 10 GlcNAc analogs were crystallographically analyzed via soaking experiments using Cj0843c crystals and found to bind to the +1 +2 saccharide subsites with one of them additionally binding to the -2 -1 subsite region. We also probed other N-acetyl-containing heterocycles and found that sialidase inhibitors N-acetyl-2,3-dehydro-2-deoxyneuraminic acid and siastatin B inhibited Cj0843c weakly and crystallographically bound to the -2 -1 subsites. Analogs of the former also showed inhibition and crystallographic binding and included zanamivir amine. This latter set of heterocycles positioned their N-acetyl group in the -2 subsite with additional moieties interacting in the -1 subsite. Overall, these results could provide novel opportunities for LT inhibition via exploring different subsites and novel scaffolds. The results also increased our mechanistic understanding of Cj0843c regarding peptidoglycan GlcNAc subsite binding preferences and ligand-dependent modulation of the protonation state of the catalytic E390.",

    "abstract": "Many types of damage, including abasic sites, block replicative DNA polymerases causing replication fork uncoupling and generating ssDNA. AP-Endonuclease 1 (APE1) has been shown to cleave abasic sites in ssDNA. Importantly, APE1 cleavage of ssDNA at a replication fork has significant biological implications by generating double strand breaks that could collapse the replication fork. Despite this, the molecular basis and efficiency of APE1 processing abasic sites at replication forks remain elusive. Here, we investigate APE1 cleavage of abasic substrates that mimic APE1 interactions at stalled replication forks or gaps. We determine that APE1 has robust activity on these substrates, like dsDNA, and report rates for cleavage and product release. X-ray structures visualize the APE1 active site, highlighting an analogous mechanism is used to process ssDNA substrates as canonical APE1 activity on dsDNA. However, mutational analysis reveals R177 to be uniquely critical for the APE1 ssDNA cleavage mechanism. Additionally, we investigate the interplay between APE1 and Replication Protein A (RPA), the major ssDNA-binding protein at replication forks, revealing that APE1 can cleave an abasic site while RPA is still bound to the DNA. Together, this work provides molecular level insights into abasic ssDNA processing by APE1, including the presence of RPA.",

P. aeruginosa forms biofilms that contribute to growth and persistence in a wide range of environments. Here we investigated the aminopeptidase, P. aeruginosa aminopeptidase (PaAP) from P. aeruginosa, which is highly abundant in the biofilm matrix. PaAP is associated with biofilm development and contributes to nutrient recycling. We confirmed that post-translational processing was required for activation and PaAP is a promiscuous aminopeptidase acting on unstructured regions of peptides and proteins. Crystal structures of wild-type enzymes and variants revealed the mechanism of autoinhibition, whereby the C-terminal propeptide locks the protease-associated domain and the catalytic peptidase domain into a self-inhibited conformation. Inspired by this, we designed a highly potent small cyclic-peptide inhibitor that recapitulates the deleterious phenotype observed with a PaAP deletion variant in biofilm assays and present a path toward targeting secreted proteins in a biofilm context.",

    "abstract": "Vaccination strategies aimed at maturing broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) from na\u00efve precursors are hindered by unusual features that characterize these Abs, including insertions and deletions (indels). Longitudinal studies of natural HIV infection cases shed light on the complex processes underlying bnAb development and have suggested a role for superinfection as a potential enhancer of neutralization breadth. Here we describe the development of a potent bnAb lineage that was elicited by two founder viruses to inform vaccine design. The V3-glycan targeting bnAb lineage (PC39-1) was isolated from subtype C-infected IAVI Protocol C elite neutralizer, donor PC39, and is defined by the presence of multiple independent insertions in CDRH1 that range from 1-11 amino acids in length. Memory B cell members of this lineage are predominantly atypical in phenotype yet also span the class-switched and antibody-secreting cell compartments. Development of neutralization breadth occurred concomitantly with extensive recombination between founder viruses before each virus separated into two distinct population \"arms\" that evolved independently to escape the PC39-1 lineage. Ab crystal structures show an extended CDRH1 that can help stabilize the CDRH3. Overall, these findings suggest that early exposure of the humoral system to multiple related Env molecules could promote the induction of bnAbs by focusing Ab responses to conserved epitopes.",

    "abstract": "The development of novel anti-infectives requires unprecedented strategies targeting pathways which are solely present in pathogens but absent in humans. Following this principle, we developed inhibitors of lipoic acid (LA) salvage, a crucial pathway for the survival of LA auxotrophic bacteria and parasites but non-essential in human cells. An LA-based probe was selectively transferred onto substrate proteins via lipoate protein ligase (LPL) in intact cells, and their binding sites were determined by mass spectrometry. Probe labeling served as a proxy of LPL activity, enabling in situ screenings for cell-permeable LPL inhibitors. Profiling a focused compound library revealed two substrate analogs (LAMe and C3) as inhibitors, which were further validated by binding studies and co-crystallography. Importantly, LAMe exhibited low toxicity in human cells and achieved killing of Plasmodium falciparum in erythrocytes with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 15\u2005\u03bcM, making it the most effective LPL inhibitor reported to date.",

    "abstract": "Protonation of key histidine residues has been long implicated in the acid-mediated cellular action of the diphtheria toxin translocation (T-) domain, responsible for the delivery of the catalytic domain into the cell. Here, we use a combination of computational (constant-pH Molecular Dynamics simulations) and experimental (NMR, circular dichroism, and fluorescence spectroscopy along with the X-ray crystallography) approaches to characterize the initial stages of conformational change happening in solution in the wild-type T-domain and in the H223Q/H257Q double mutant. This replacement suppresses the acid-induced transition, resulting in the retention of a more stable protein structure in solutions at pH 5.5 and, consequently, in reduced membrane-disrupting activity. Here, for the first time, we report the pK<sub>a</sub> values of the histidine residues of the T-domain, measured by NMR-monitored pH titrations. Most peaks in the histidine side chain spectral region are titrated with pK<sub>a</sub>s ranging from 6.2 to 6.8. However, the two most up-field peaks display little change down to pH 6, which is a limiting pH for this protein in solution at concentrations required for NMR. These peaks are absent in the double mutant, suggesting they belong to H223 and H257. The constant-pH simulations indicate that for the T-domain in solution, the pK<sub>a</sub> values for histidine residues range from 3.0 to 6.5, with those most difficult to protonate being H251 and H257. Taken together, our experimental and computational data demonstrate that previously suggested cooperative protonation of all six histidines in the T-domain does not occur.",

    "abstract": "Cytochromes P450 (CYPs) are heme-thiolate monooxygenases that prototypically catalyze the insertion of oxygen into unactivated C-H bonds but are capable of mediating more complex reactions. One of the most remarked-upon alternative reactions occurs during biosynthesis of the gibberellin A (GA) phytohormones, involving hydrocarbon ring contraction with coupled aldehyde extrusion of <i>ent</i>-kaurenoic acid to form the first gibberellin intermediate. While the unusual nature of this reaction has long been noted, its mechanistic basis has remained opaque. Building on identification of the relevant CYP114 from bacterial GA biosynthesis, detailed structure-function studies are reported here, including development of in\u00a0vitro assays as well as crystallographic analyses both in the absence and presence of substrate. These structures provided insight into enzymatic catalysis of this unusual reaction, as exemplified by identification of a key role for the \"missing\" acid from an otherwise highly conserved acid-alcohol pair of residues. Notably, the results demonstrate that ring contraction requires dual factors, both the use of a dedicated ferredoxin and absence of the otherwise conserved acidic residue, with exclusion of either limiting turnover to just the initiating and more straightforward hydroxylation. The results provide detailed insight into the enzymatic structure-function relationships underlying this fascinating reaction and support the use of a semipinacol mechanism for the unusual ring contraction reaction.",

    "abstract": "The symptoms of malaria occur during the blood stage of infection, when the parasite replicates within human red blood cells. The human malaria parasite, Plasmodium vivax, selectively invades reticulocytes in a process which requires an interaction between the ectodomain of the human DARC receptor and the Plasmodium vivax Duffy-binding protein, PvDBP. Previous studies have revealed that a small helical peptide from DARC binds to region II of PvDBP (PvDBP-RII). However, it is also known that sulphation of tyrosine residues on DARC affects its binding to PvDBP and these residues were not observed in previous structures. We therefore present the structure of PvDBP-RII bound to sulphated DARC peptide, showing that a sulphate on tyrosine 41 binds to a charged pocket on PvDBP-RII. We use molecular dynamics simulations, affinity measurements and growth-inhibition experiments in parasites to confirm the importance of this interaction. We also reveal the epitope for vaccine-elicited growth-inhibitory antibody DB1. This provides a complete understanding of the binding of PvDBP-RII to DARC and will guide the design of vaccines and therapeutics to target this essential interaction.",

However, the use of the absolute B-factor as a probe for protein motion requires reproducible validation against conformational changes against chemical and physical variables. Here we report the investigation of the thermal dependence of the crystallographic B-factor and its correlation with conformational changes of the protein. We obtained the crystal protein structure coordinates and B-factors at high resolution (1.5\u00a0\u00c5) over a broad temperature range (100\u00a0K to 325\u00a0K). The exponential thermal dependence of B-factor as a function of temperature was equal for both the diffraction intensity data (Wilson B-factor) and for all modeled atoms of the system (protein and non-protein atoms), with a thermal diffusion constant of about 0.0045\u00a0K<sup>-1</sup>, similar for all atoms. The extrapolated B-factor at zero Kelvin (or zero-point fluctuation) varies among the atoms, although with no apparent correlation with temperature-dependent protein conformational changes. These data suggest that the thermal vibration of the atom does not necessarily correlate with the conformational dynamics of the protein.",

These small molecules act as molecular glues promoting hyper-multimerization of HIV-1 IN protein to severely perturb maturation of viral particles. Herein, we describe a new series of INLAIs based on a benzene scaffold that display antiviral activity in the single digit nanomolar range. Akin to other compounds of this class, the INLAIs predominantly inhibit the late stages of HIV-1 replication. A series of high-resolution crystal structures revealed how these small molecules engage the catalytic core and the C-terminal domains of HIV-1 IN. No antagonism was observed between our lead INLAI compound BDM-2 and a panel of 16 clinical antiretrovirals. Moreover, we show that compounds retained high antiviral activity against HIV-1 variants resistant to IN strand transfer inhibitors and other classes of antiretroviral drugs. The virologic profile of BDM-2 and the recently completed single ascending dose phase I trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03634085) warrant further clinical investigation for use in combination with other antiretroviral drugs. Moreover, our results suggest routes for further improvement of this emerging drug class.",

    "abstract": "2',3'-cGAMP, produced by the DNA sensor cGAS, activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and triggers immune response during infection. Tremendous effort has been placed on unraveling the mechanism of STING activation. However, little is known about STING inhibition. Here, we found that apo-STING exhibits a bilayer with head-to-head as well as side-by-side packing, mediated by its ligand-binding domain (LBD). This type of assembly holds two endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes together not only to prevent STING ER exit but also to eliminate the recruitment of TBK1, representing the autoinhibited state of STING. Additionally, we obtained the filament structure of the STING/2',3'-cGAMP complex, which adopts a bent monolayer assembly mediated by LBD and transmembrane domain (TMD). The active, curved STING polymer could deform ER membrane to support its ER exit and anterograde transportation. Our data together provide a panoramic vision regarding STING autoinhibition and activation, which adds substantially to current understanding of the cGAS-STING pathway.",

    "abstract": "A wide range of endogenous and xenobiotic organic ions require facilitated transport systems to cross the plasma membrane for their disposition. In mammals, organic cation transporter (OCT) subtypes 1 and 2 (OCT1 and OCT2, also known as SLC22A1 and SLC22A2, respectively) are polyspecific transporters responsible for the uptake and clearance of structurally diverse cationic compounds in the liver and kidneys, respectively. Notably, it is well established that human OCT1 and OCT2 play central roles in the pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of many prescription medications, including metformin. Despite their importance, the basis of polyspecific cationic drug recognition and the alternating access mechanism for OCTs have remained a mystery. Here we present four cryo-electron microscopy structures of apo, substrate-bound and drug-bound OCT1 and OCT2 consensus variants, in outward-facing and outward-occluded states. Together with functional experiments, in silico docking and molecular dynamics simulations, these structures uncover general principles of organic cation recognition by OCTs and provide insights into extracellular gate occlusion. Our findings set the stage for a comprehensive structure-based understanding of OCT-mediated drug-drug interactions, which will prove critical in the preclinical evaluation of emerging therapeutics.",

From this sample we identified and simultaneously determined high-resolution structural information for ten unique human liver enzymes involved in diverse cellular processes. Notably, we determined the structure of the endoplasmic bifunctional protein H6PD, where the N- and C-terminal domains independently possess glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconolactonase enzymatic activity, respectively. We also obtained the structure of heterodimeric human GANAB, an ER glycoprotein quality-control machinery that contains a catalytic \u03b1 subunit and a noncatalytic \u03b2 subunit. In addition, we observed a decameric peroxidase, PRDX4, which directly contacts a disulfide isomerase-related protein, ERp46. Structural data suggest that several glycosylations, bound endogenous compounds, and ions associate with these human liver enzymes. These results highlight the importance of cryo-EM in facilitating the elucidation of human organ proteomics at the atomic level.",

    "abstract": "Many proteins naturally carry metal centers, with a large share of them being in the active sites of several enzymes. Paramagnetic effects are a powerful source of structural information and, therefore, if the native metal is paramagnetic, or it can be functionally substituted with a paramagnetic one, paramagnetic effects can be used to study the metal sites, as well as the overall structure of the protein. One notable example is cobalt(II) substitution for zinc(II) in carbonic anhydrase. In this manuscript we investigate the effects of sodium thiocyanate on the chemical environment of the metal ion of the human carbonic anhydrase II. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) titration of the cobalt(II) protein with thiocyanate shows that the EPR spectrum changes from A-type to C-type on passing from 1:1 to 1:1000-fold ligand excess. This indicates the occurrence of a change in the electronic structure, which may reflect a sizable change in the metal coordination environment in turn caused by a modification of the frozen solvent glass. However, paramagnetic nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data indicate that the metal coordination cage remains unperturbed even in 1:1000-fold ligand excess. This result proves that the C-type EPR spectrum observed at large ligand concentration should be ascribed to the low temperature at which EPR measurements are performed, which impacts on the structure of the protein when it is destabilized by a high concentration of a chaotropic agent.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The NSP15 endoribonuclease enzyme, known as NendoU, is highly conserved and plays a critical role in the ability of the virus to evade the immune system. NendoU is a promising target for the development of new antiviral drugs. However, the complexity of the enzyme's structure and kinetics, along with the broad range of recognition sequences and lack of structural complexes, hampers the development of inhibitors. Here, we performed enzymatic characterization of NendoU in its monomeric and hexameric form, showing that hexamers are allosteric enzymes with a positive cooperative index, and with no influence of manganese on enzymatic activity. Through combining cryo-electron microscopy at different pHs, X-ray crystallography and biochemical and structural analysis, we showed that NendoU can shift between open and closed forms, which probably correspond to active and inactive states, respectively. We also explored the possibility of NendoU assembling into larger supramolecular structures and proposed a mechanism for allosteric regulation. In addition, we conducted a large fragment screening campaign against NendoU and identified several new allosteric sites that could be targeted for the development of new inhibitors. Overall, our findings provide insights into the complex structure and function of NendoU and offer new opportunities for the development of inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "The <i>Myoviridae</i> phage tail is a common component of contractile injection systems (CISs), essential for exerting contractile function and facilitating membrane penetration of the inner tail tube. The near-atomic resolution structures of the <i>Myoviridae</i> tail have been extensively studied, but the dynamic conformational changes before and after contraction and the associated molecular mechanism are still unclear. Here, we present the extended and contracted intact tail-structures of <i>Myoviridae</i> phage P1 by cryo-EM. The ultra-long tail of P1, 2450 \u00c5 in length, consists of a neck, a tail terminator, 53 repeated tail sheath rings, 53 repeated tube rings, and a baseplate. The sheath of the contracted tail shrinks by approximately 55%, resulting in the separation of the inner rigid tail tube from the sheath. The extended and contracted tails were further resolved by local reconstruction at 3.3 \u00c5 and 3.9 \u00c5 resolutions, respectively, allowing us to build the atomic models of the tail terminator protein gp24, the tube protein BplB, and the sheath protein gp22 for the extended tail, and of the sheath protein gp22 for the contracted tail. Our atomic models reveal the complex interaction network in the ultra-long <i>Myoviridae</i> tail and the novel conformational changes of the tail sheath between extended and contracted states. Our structures provide insights into the contraction and stabilization mechanisms of the <i>Myoviridae</i> tail.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitors of triacylglycerol (TG) synthesis have been developed to treat metabolism-related diseases, but we know little about their mechanisms of action. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of the TG-synthesis enzyme acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), a membrane bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT), in complex with two different inhibitors, T863 and DGAT1IN1. Each inhibitor binds DGAT1's fatty acyl-CoA substrate binding tunnel that opens to the cytoplasmic side of the ER. T863 blocks access to the tunnel entrance, whereas DGAT1IN1 extends further into the enzyme, with an amide group interacting with more deeply buried catalytic residues. A survey of DGAT1 inhibitors revealed that this amide group may serve as a common pharmacophore for inhibition of MBOATs. The inhibitors were minimally active against the related MBOAT acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1), yet a single-residue mutation sensitized ACAT1 for inhibition. Collectively, our studies provide a structural foundation for developing DGAT1 and other MBOAT inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "In all species, ribosomes synthesize proteins by faithfully decoding messenger RNA (mRNA) nucleotide sequences using aminoacyl-tRNA substrates. Current knowledge of the decoding mechanism derives principally from studies on bacterial systems<sup>1</sup>. Although key features are conserved across evolution<sup>2</sup>, eukaryotes achieve higher-fidelity mRNA decoding than bacteria<sup>3</sup>. In human, changes in decoding fidelity are linked to ageing and disease and represent a potential point of therapeutic intervention in both viral and cancer treatment<sup>4-6</sup>. Here we combine single-molecule imaging and cryogenic electron microscopy methods to examine the molecular basis of human ribosome\u00a0fidelity to reveal that the decoding mechanism is both kinetically and structurally distinct from that of bacteria. Although decoding is globally analogous in both species, the reaction coordinate of aminoacyl-tRNA movement is altered on the human ribosome and the process is an order of magnitude slower. These distinctions arise from eukaryote-specific structural elements in the human ribosome and in the elongation factor eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) that together coordinate faithful tRNA incorporation at each mRNA codon. The distinct nature and timing of conformational changes within the ribosome and eEF1A rationalize how increased decoding fidelity is achieved and potentially regulated in eukaryotic species.",

Promiscuous OMT biocatalysts are thus a valuable asset in the toolkit for sustainable synthesis and optimization of known bioactive scaffolds for drug development. Here, we characterized the enzymatic properties and substrate scope of two bacterial OMTs from Desulforomonas acetoxidans and Streptomyces avermitilis and determined their crystal structures. Both OMTs methylated a wide range of catechol-like substrates, including flavonoids, coumarins, hydroxybenzoic acids, and their respective aldehydes, an anthraquinone and an indole. One enzyme also accepted a steroid. The product range included pharmaceutically relevant compounds such as (iso)fraxidin, iso(scopoletin), chrysoeriol, alizarin 1-methyl ether, and 2-methoxyestradiol. Interestingly, certain non-catechol flavonoids and hydroxybenzoic acids were also methylated. This study expands the knowledge on substrate preference and structural diversity of bacterial catechol OMTs and paves the way for their use in (combinatorial) pathway engineering.",

Here, we describe the high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of decarboxylated osteocalcin under acidic conditions. Decarboxylated osteocalcin at pH 2.0 retains the \u03b1-helix structure of native osteocalcin with three \u03b3-carboxyglutamic acid residues at neutral pH. This implies that decarboxylated osteocalcin is stable under an acidic environment in bone. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis revealed that Glu17 and Glu21 are important for the adiponectin-inducing activity of decarboxylated osteocalcin. These findings suggest that the receptor of decarboxylated osteocalcin responds to the negative charge in helix 1 of osteocalcin.",

    "abstract": "Several antibody therapeutics have been developed against SARS-CoV-2; however, they have attenuated neutralizing ability against variants. In this study, we generated multiple broadly neutralizing antibodies from B cells of convalescents, by using two types of receptor-binding domains, Wuhan strain and the Gamma variant as bait. From 172 antibodies generated, six antibodies neutralized all strains prior to the Omicron variant, and the five antibodies were able to neutralize some of the Omicron sub-strains. Structural analysis showed that these antibodies have a variety of characteristic binding modes, such as ACE2 mimicry. We subjected a representative antibody to the hamster infection model after introduction of the N297A modification, and observed a dose-dependent reduction of the lung viral titer, even at a dose of 2\u00a0mg/kg. These results demonstrated that our antibodies have certain antiviral activity as therapeutics, and highlighted the importance of initial cell-screening strategy for the efficient development of therapeutic antibodies.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorylation is a ubiquitous post-translation modification that regulates protein function by promoting, inhibiting or modulating protein-protein interactions. Hundreds of thousands of phosphosites have been identified but the vast majority have not been functionally characterised and it remains a challenge to decipher phosphorylation events modulating interactions. We generated a phosphomimetic\u00a0proteomic peptide-phage display library to screen for phosphosites that modulate short linear motif-based interactions. The peptidome covers ~13,500 phospho-serine/threonine sites found in the intrinsically disordered regions of the human proteome. Each phosphosite is represented as wild-type and phosphomimetic variant. We screened 71 protein domains to identify 248 phosphosites that modulate motif-mediated interactions. Affinity measurements confirmed the phospho-modulation of 14 out of 18 tested interactions. We performed a detailed follow-up on a phospho-dependent interaction between clathrin and the mitotic spindle protein hepatoma-upregulated protein (HURP), demonstrating the essentiality of the phospho-dependency to the mitotic function of HURP. Structural characterisation of the clathrin-HURP complex elucidated the molecular basis for the phospho-dependency. Our work showcases the power of phosphomimetic ProP-PD to discover novel phospho-modulated interactions required for cellular function.",

    "abstract": "Photosystem II (PSII) utilizes light energy to split water, and the electrons extracted from water are transferred to Q<sub>B</sub>, a plastoquinone molecule bound to the D1 subunit of PSII. Many artificial electron acceptors (AEAs) with molecular structures similar to that of plastoquinone can accept electrons from PSII. However, the molecular mechanism by which AEAs act on PSII is unclear. Here, we solved the crystal structure of PSII treated with three different AEAs, 2,5-dibromo-1,4-benzoquinone, 2,6-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone, and 2-phenyl-1,4-benzoquinone, at 1.95 to 2.10\u00a0\u00c5 resolution. Our results show that all AEAs substitute for Q<sub>B</sub> and are bound to the Q<sub>B</sub>-binding site (Q<sub>B</sub> site) to receive electrons, but their binding strengths are different, resulting in differences in their efficiencies to accept electrons. The acceptor 2-phenyl-1,4-benzoquinone binds most weakly to the Q<sub>B</sub> site and showed the highest oxygen-evolving activity, implying a reverse relationship between the binding strength and oxygen-evolving activity. In addition, a novel quinone-binding site, designated the Q<sub>D</sub> site, was discovered, which is located in the vicinity of Q<sub>B</sub> site and close to Q<sub>C</sub> site, a binding site reported previously. This Q<sub>D</sub> site is expected to play a role as a channel or a storage site for quinones to be transported to the Q<sub>B</sub> site. These results provide the structural basis for elucidating the actions of AEAs and exchange mechanism of Q<sub>B</sub> in PSII and also provide information for the design of more efficient electron acceptors.",

    "abstract": "Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, whilst leishmaniasis, which is caused by over 20 species of Leishmania, represents a group of NTDs endemic to most countries in the tropical and subtropical belt of the planet. These diseases remain a significant health problem both in endemic countries and globally. These parasites and other trypanosomatids, including T. theileri, a bovine pathogen, rely on cysteine biosynthesis for the production of trypanothione, which is essential for parasite survival in hosts. The de novo pathway of cysteine biosynthesis requires the conversion of O-acetyl-L-serine into L-cysteine, which is catalysed by cysteine synthase (CS). These enzymes present potential for drug development against T.\u00a0cruzi, Leishmania spp. and T. theileri. To enable these possibilities, biochemical and crystallographic studies of CS from T. cruzi (TcCS), L.\u00a0infantum (LiCS) and T.\u00a0theileri (TthCS) were conducted. Crystal structures of the three enzymes were determined at resolutions of 1.80\u2005\u00c5 for TcCS, 1.75\u2005\u00c5 for LiCS and 2.75\u2005\u00c5 for TthCS. These three homodimeric structures show the same overall fold and demonstrate that the active-site geometry is conserved, supporting a common reaction mechanism. Detailed structural analysis revealed reaction intermediates of the de novo pathway ranging from an apo structure of LiCS and holo structures of both TcCS and TthCS to the substrate-bound structure of TcCS. These structures will allow exploration of the active site for the design of novel inhibitors. Additionally, unexpected binding sites discovered at the dimer interface represent new potential for the development of protein-protein inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "The streptothricin natural product mixture (also known as nourseothricin) was discovered in the early 1940s, generating intense initial interest because of excellent gram-negative activity. Here, we establish the activity spectrum of nourseothricin and its main components, streptothricin F (S-F, 1 lysine) and streptothricin D (S-D, 3 lysines), purified to homogeneity, against highly drug-resistant, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) and Acinetobacter baumannii. For CRE, the MIC50 and MIC90 for S-F and S-D were 2 and 4 \u03bcM, and 0.25 and 0.5 \u03bcM, respectively. S-F and nourseothricin showed rapid, bactericidal activity. S-F and S-D both showed approximately 40-fold greater selectivity for prokaryotic than eukaryotic ribosomes in in vitro translation assays. In vivo, delayed renal toxicity occurred at >10-fold higher doses of S-F compared with S-D. Substantial treatment effect of S-F in the murine thigh model was observed against the otherwise pandrug-resistant, NDM-1-expressing Klebsiella pneumoniae Nevada strain with minimal or no toxicity. Cryo-EM characterization of S-F bound to the A. baumannii 70S ribosome defines extensive hydrogen bonding of the S-F steptolidine moiety, as a guanine mimetic, to the 16S rRNA C1054 nucleobase (Escherichia coli numbering) in helix 34, and the carbamoylated gulosamine moiety of S-F with A1196, explaining the high-level resistance conferred by corresponding mutations at the residues identified in single rrn operon E. coli. Structural analysis suggests that S-F probes the A-decoding site, which potentially may account for its miscoding activity. Based on unique and promising activity, we suggest that the streptothricin scaffold deserves further preclinical exploration as a potential therapeutic for drug-resistant, gram-negative pathogens.",

We also find that its ancestor, mCherry, undergoes a similar fluorescence loss but at a slower rate. X-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry reveal that this is caused by the cleavage of the p-hydroxyphenyl ring from the chromophore and the formation of two novel types of cyclic structures at the remaining chromophore moiety. Overall, our work sheds light on a new process occurring within fluorescent proteins, further adding to the chemical diversity and versatility of these molecules.",

    "abstract": "Modification of the polyketide anthraquinone AQ-256 in the entomopathogenic Photorhabdus\u00a0luminescens involves several O-methylations, but the biosynthetic gene cluster antA-I lacks corresponding tailoring enzymes. We here describe the identification of five putative, highly homologous O-methyltransferases encoded in the genome of P.\u00a0luminescens. Activity assays in\u00a0vitro and deletion experiments in\u00a0vivo revealed that three of them account for anthraquinone tailoring by producing three monomethylated and two dimethylated species of AQ-256. X-ray structures of all five enzymes indicate high structural and mechanistic similarity. As confirmed by structure-based mutagenesis, a conserved histidine at the active site likely functions as a general base for substrate deprotonation and subsequent methyl transfer in all enzymes. Eight complex structures with AQ-256 as well as mono- and dimethylated derivatives confirm the substrate specificity patterns found in\u00a0vitro and visualize how single amino acid differences in the active-site pockets impact substrate orientation and govern site-specific methylation.",

    "abstract": "The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (M<sup>pro</sup>) is the most promising drug target against coronaviruses due to its essential role in virus replication. With newly emerging variants there is a concern that mutations in M<sup>pro</sup> may alter the structural and functional properties of protease and subsequently the potency of existing and potential antivirals. We explored the effect of 31 mutations belonging to 5 variants of concern (VOCs) on catalytic parameters and substrate specificity, which revealed changes in substrate binding and the rate of cleavage of a viral peptide. Crystal structures of 11 M<sup>pro</sup> mutants provided structural insight into their altered functionality. Additionally, we show M<sup>pro</sup> mutations influence proteolysis of an immunomodulatory host protein Galectin-8 (Gal-8) and a subsequent significant decrease in cytokine secretion, providing evidence for alterations in the escape of host-antiviral mechanisms. Accordingly, mutations associated with the Gamma VOC and highly virulent Delta VOC resulted in a significant increase in Gal-8 cleavage. Importantly, IC50s of nirmatrelvir (Pfizer) and our irreversible inhibitor AVI-8053 demonstrated no changes in potency for both drugs for all mutants, suggesting M<sup>pro</sup> will remain a high-priority antiviral drug candidate as SARS-CoV-2 evolves.",

    "abstract": "Periplasmic \u03b1-amylase MalS (EC. 3.2.1.1), which belongs to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 13 subfamily 19, is an integral component of the maltose utilization pathway in <i>Escherichia coli</i> K12 and used among Ecnterobacteriaceae for the effective utilization of maltodextrin. We present the crystal structure of MalS from <i>E. coli</i> and reveal that it has unique structural features of circularly permutated domains and a possible CBM69. The conventional C-domain of amylase consists of amino acids 120-180 (N-terminal) and 646-676 (C-terminal) in MalS, and the whole domain architecture shows the complete circular permutation of C-A-B-A-C in domain order. Regarding substrate interaction, the enzyme has a 6-glucosyl unit pocket binding it to the non-reducing end of the cleavage site. Our study found that residues D385 and F367 play important roles in the preference of MalS for maltohexaose as an initial product. At the active site of MalS, \u03b2-CD binds more weakly than the linear substrate, possibly due to the positioning of A402. MalS has two Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding sites that contribute significantly to the thermostability of the enzyme. Intriguingly, the study found that MalS exhibits a high binding affinity for polysaccharides such as glycogen and amylopectin. The N domain, of which the electron density map was not observed, was predicted to be CBM69 by AlphaFold2 and might have a binding site for the polysaccharides. Structural analysis of MalS provides new insight into the structure-evolution relationship in GH13 subfamily 19 enzymes and a molecular basis for understanding the details of catalytic function and substrate binding of MalS.",

To identify protective antibodies, we immunized macaques with a mixture of western, eastern, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus-like particles (VLPs), a regimen that protects against aerosol challenge with all three viruses. Single- and triple-virus-specific antibodies were isolated, and we identified 21 unique binding groups. Cryo-EM structures revealed that broad VLP binding inversely correlated with sequence and conformational variability. One triple-specific antibody, SKT05, bound proximal to the fusion peptide and neutralized all three Env-pseudotyped encephalitic alphaviruses by using different symmetry elements for recognition across VLPs. Neutralization in other assays (e.g., chimeric Sindbis virus) yielded variable results. SKT05 bound backbone atoms of sequence-diverse residues, enabling broad recognition despite sequence variability; accordingly, SKT05 protected mice against Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, chikungunya virus, and Ross River virus challenges. Thus, a single vaccine-elicited antibody can protect in\u00a0vivo against a broad range of alphaviruses.",

    "abstract": "CrAssphage and related viruses of the order Crassvirales (hereafter referred to as crassviruses) were originally discovered by cross-assembly of metagenomic sequences. They are the most abundant viruses in the human gut, are found in the majority of individual gut viromes, and account for up to 95% of the viral sequences in some individuals<sup>1-4</sup>. Crassviruses are likely to have major roles in shaping the composition and functionality of the human microbiome, but the structures and roles of most of the virally encoded proteins are unknown, with only generic predictions resulting from bioinformatic analyses<sup>4,5</sup>. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of Bacteroides intestinalis virus \u03a6crAss001<sup>6</sup>, providing the structural basis for the functional assignment of most of its virion proteins. The muzzle protein forms an assembly about 1\u2009MDa in size at the end of the tail and exhibits a previously unknown fold that we designate the 'crass fold', that is likely to serve as a gatekeeper that controls the ejection of cargos. In addition to packing the approximately 103\u2009kb of virus DNA, the \u03a6crAss001 virion has extensive storage space for virally encoded cargo proteins in the capsid and, unusually, within the tail. One of the cargo proteins is present in both the capsid and the tail, suggesting a general mechanism for protein ejection, which involves partial unfolding of proteins during their extrusion through the tail. These findings provide a structural basis for understanding the mechanisms of assembly and infection of these highly abundant crassviruses.",

    "abstract": "Picornavirus genome replication takes place in specialized intracellular membrane compartments that concentrate viral RNA and proteins as well as a number of host factors that also participate in the process. The core enzyme in the replication machinery is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) 3Dpol. Replication requires the primer protein 3B (or VPg) attached to two uridine molecules. 3B uridylylation is also catalysed by 3Dpol. Another critical interaction in picornavirus replication is that between 3Dpol and the precursor 3AB, a membrane-binding protein responsible for the localization of 3Dpol to the membranous compartments at which replication occurs. Unlike other picornaviruses, the animal pathogen foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), encodes three non-identical copies of the 3B (3B1, 3B2, and 3B3) that could be specialized in different functions within the replication complex. Here, we have used a combination of biophysics, molecular and structural biology approaches to characterize the functional binding of FMDV 3B1 to the base of the palm of 3Dpol. The 1.7 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of the FMDV 3Dpol -3B1 complex shows that 3B1 simultaneously links two 3Dpol molecules by binding at the bottom of their palm subdomains in an almost symmetric way. The two 3B1 contact surfaces involve a combination of hydrophobic and basic residues at the N- (G5-P6, R9; Region I) and C-terminus (R16, L19-P20; Region II) of this small protein. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) show that the two 3B1 binding sites play a role in 3Dpol binding, with region II presenting the highest affinity. ELISA assays show that 3Dpol has higher binding affinity for 3B1 than for 3B2 or 3B3. Membrane-based pull-down assays show that 3B1 region II, and to a lesser extent also region I play essential roles in mediating the interaction of 3AB with the polymerase and its recruitment to intracellular membranes.",

We report here that ADGRF1 can signal through all major G protein classes and identify the structural basis for a previously reported G\u03b1<sub>q</sub> preference by cryo-EM. Our structure shows that G\u03b1<sub>q</sub> preference in ADGRF1 may derive from tighter packing at the conserved F569 of the TA, altering contacts between TM helix I and VII, with a concurrent rearrangement of TM helix VII and helix VIII at the site of G\u03b1 recruitment. Mutational studies of the interface and of contact residues within the 7TM domain identify residues critical for signalling, and suggest that G\u03b1<sub>s</sub> signalling is more sensitive to mutation of TA or binding site residues than G\u03b1<sub>q</sub>. Our work advances the detailed molecular understanding of aGPCR TA activation, identifying features that potentially explain preferential signal modulation.",

    "abstract": "The conversion of hits to leads in drug discovery involves the elaboration of chemical core structures to increase their potency. In fragment-based drug discovery, low-molecular-weight compounds are tested for protein binding and are subsequently modified, with the tacit assumption that the binding mode of the original hit will be conserved among the derivatives. However, deviations from binding mode conservation are rather frequently observed, but potential causes of these alterations remain incompletely understood. Here, two crystal forms of the spliceosomal RNA helicase BRR2 were employed as a test case to explore the consequences of conformational changes in the target protein on the binding behaviour of fragment derivatives. The initial fragment, sulfaguanidine, bound at the interface between the two helicase cassettes of BRR2 in one crystal form. Second-generation compounds devised by structure-guided docking were probed for their binding to BRR2 in a second crystal form, in which the original fragment-binding site was altered due to a conformational change. While some of the second-generation compounds retained binding to parts of the original site, others changed to different binding pockets of the protein. A structural bioinformatics analysis revealed that the fragment-binding sites correspond to predicted binding hot spots, which strongly depend on the protein conformation. This case study offers an example of extensive binding-mode changes during hit derivatization, which are likely to occur as a consequence of multiple binding hot spots, some of which are sensitive to the flexibility of the protein.",

Protein crystals are mounted on canonical micromeshes on an electropneumatic piston, where the crystals are kept in a humidity and temperature-controlled environment, then reactions are initiated via the liquid application method (LAMA) and plunging into liquid nitrogen is initiated after an electronically set delay time to cryo-trap intermediate states. High-magnification images are automatically recorded before and after droplet deposition, prior to plunging. The SPINE-standard sample holder is directly plunged into a storage puck, enabling compatibility with high-throughput infrastructure. Here we demonstrate binding of glucose and 2,3-butanediol in microcrystals of xylose isomerase, and of avibactam and ampicillin in microcrystals of the extended spectrum beta-lactamase CTX-M-14. We also trap reaction intermediates and conformational changes in macroscopic crystals of tryptophan synthase to demonstrate that the spitrobot enables insight into catalytic events.",

The native structure was solved at a resolution of 2.3\u2005\u00c5 and the structure of the cleaved conformation was solved at 2.0\u2005\u00c5 resolution. Furthermore, structural changes were observed when the reactive-centre loop transitioned from the native conformation to the cleaved conformation.

The presence of glutamate instead of the typical arginine in the P1 recognition site of all structurally characterized I. ricinus serpins (PDB entries 7b2t, 7pmu and 7ahp), except for the tyrosine in the P1 site of Iripin-2 (formerly IRS-2; PDB entry 3nda), would explain the absence of inhibition of the tested proteases that cleave their substrate after arginine.

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas systems are widespread adaptive antiviral systems used in prokaryotes. Some phages, in turn, although have small genomes can economize the use of genetic space to encode compact or incomplete CRISPR-Cas systems to inhibit the host and establish infection. Phage ICP1, infecting <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>, encodes a compact type I-F CRISPR-Cas system to suppress the antiphage mobile genetic element in the host genome. However, the mechanism by which this compact system recognizes the target DNA and executes interference remains elusive. Here, we present the electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of both apo- and DNA-bound ICP1 surveillance complexes (Aka Csy complex). Unlike most other type I surveillance complexes, the ICP1 Csy complex lacks the Cas11 subunit or a structurally homologous domain, which is crucial for dsDNA binding and Cas3 activation in other type I CRISPR-Cas systems. Structural and functional analyses revealed that the compact ICP1 Csy complex alone is inefficient in binding to dsDNA targets, presumably stalled at a partial R-loop conformation. The presence of Cas2/3 facilitates dsDNA binding and allows effective dsDNA target cleavage. Additionally, we found that <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> Cas2/3 efficiently cleaved the dsDNA target presented by the ICP1 Csy complex, but not vice versa. These findings suggest a unique mechanism for target dsDNA binding and cleavage by the compact phage-derived CRISPR-Cas system.",

    "abstract": "Transposases are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze DNA rearrangement events with broad impacts on gene expression, genome evolution, and the spread of drug-resistance in bacteria. Here, we use biochemical and structural approaches to define the molecular determinants by which IstA, a transposase present in the widespread IS21 family of mobile elements, catalyzes efficient DNA transposition. Solution studies show that IstA engages the transposon terminal sequences to form a high-molecular weight complex and promote DNA integration. A 3.4\u2009\u00c5 resolution structure of the transposase bound to transposon ends corroborates our biochemical findings and reveals that IstA self-assembles into a highly intertwined tetramer that synapses two supercoiled terminal inverted repeats. The three-dimensional organization of the IstA\u2022DNA cleaved donor complex reveals remarkable similarities with retroviral integrases and classic transposase systems, such as Tn7 and bacteriophage Mu, and provides insights into IS21 transposition.",

Galactan synthase 1 (GalS1) transfers galactose and arabinose to either extend or cap the \u03b2-1,4-galactan side chains of RGI, respectively. Here we report the structure of GalS1 from Populus trichocarpa, showing a modular protein consisting of an N-terminal domain that represents the founding member of a new family of carbohydrate-binding module, CBM95, and a C-terminal glycosyltransferase family 92 (GT92) catalytic domain that adopts a GT-A fold. GalS1 exists as a dimer in vitro, with stem domains interacting across the chains in a 'handshake' orientation that is essential for maintaining stability and activity. In addition to understanding the enzymatic mechanism of GalS1, we gained insight into the donor and acceptor substrate binding sites using deep evolutionary analysis, molecular simulations and biochemical studies. Combining all the results, a mechanism for GalS1 catalysis and a new model for pectic galactan side-chain addition are proposed.",

It is caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV), a double-stranded DNA virus from the Poxviridae family, that replicates in the cytoplasm and must encode for its own RNA processing machinery including the capping machinery. Here, we present crystal structures of its 2'-O-RNA methyltransferase (MTase) VP39 in complex with the pan-MTase inhibitor sinefungin and a series of inhibitors that were discovered based on it. A comparison of this 2'-O-RNA MTase with enzymes from unrelated single-stranded RNA viruses (SARS-CoV-2 and Zika) reveals a conserved sinefungin binding mode, implicating that a single inhibitor could be used against unrelated viral families. Indeed, several of our inhibitors such as TO507 also inhibit the coronaviral nsp14 MTase.",

    "abstract": "Inactivation of tetracycline antibiotics by tetracycline destructases (TDases) remains a clinical and agricultural threat. TDases can be classified as type 1 Tet(X)-like TDases and type 2 soil-derived TDases. Type 1 TDases are widely identified in clinical pathogens. A combination therapy of tetracycline and a TDase inhibitor is much needed to rescue the clinical efficacy of tetracyclines. Anhydrotetracycline is a pan-TDase inhibitor that inhibits both type 1 and type 2 TDases. Here, we present structural, biochemical, and phenotypic evidence that anhydrotetracycline binds in a substrate-like orientation and competitively inhibits the type 1 TDase Tet(X6) to rescue tetracycline antibiotic activity as a sacrificial substrate. Anhydrotetracycline interacting residues of Tet(X6) are conserved within type 1 TDases, indicating a conserved binding mode and mechanism of inhibition. This mode of binding and inhibition is distinct from anhydrotetracycline's inhibition of type 2 TDases. This study forms the framework for development of next-generation therapies to counteract enzymatic tetracycline resistance.",

    "abstract": "The biological function of macromolecular complexes depends not only on large-scale transitions between conformations, but also on small-scale conformational fluctuations at equilibrium. Information on the equilibrium dynamics of biomolecular complexes could, in principle, be obtained from local resolution (LR) data in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps. However, this possibility had not been validated by comparing, for a same biomolecular complex, LR data with quantitative information on equilibrium dynamics obtained by an established solution technique. In this study we determined the cryo-EM structure of the minute virus of mice (MVM) capsid as a model biomolecular complex. The LR values obtained correlated with crystallographic B factors and with hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) rates obtained by mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), a gold standard for determining equilibrium dynamics in solution. This result validated a LR-based cryo-EM approach to investigate, with high spatial resolution, the equilibrium dynamics of biomolecular complexes. As an application of this approach, we determined the cryo-EM structure of two mutant MVM capsids and compared their equilibrium dynamics with that of the wild-type MVM capsid. The results supported a previously suggested linkage between mechanical stiffening and impaired equilibrium dynamics of a virus particle. Cryo-EM is emerging as a powerful approach for simultaneously acquiring information on the atomic structure and local equilibrium dynamics of biomolecular complexes.",

    "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) within the same subfamily often share high homology in their orthosteric pocket and therefore pose challenges to drug development. The amino acids that form the orthosteric binding pocket for epinephrine and norepinephrine in the \u03b2<sub>1</sub> and \u03b2<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptors (\u03b2<sub>1</sub>AR and \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR) are identical. Here, to examine the effect of conformational restriction on ligand binding kinetics, we synthesized a constrained form of epinephrine. Surprisingly, the constrained epinephrine exhibits over 100-fold selectivity for the \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR over the \u03b2<sub>1</sub>AR. We provide evidence that the selectivity may be due to reduced ligand flexibility that enhances the association rate for the \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR, as well as a less stable binding pocket for constrained epinephrine in the \u03b2<sub>1</sub>AR. The differences in the amino acid sequence of the extracellular vestibule of the \u03b2<sub>1</sub>AR allosterically alter the shape and stability of the binding pocket, resulting in a marked difference in affinity compared to the \u03b2<sub>2</sub>AR. These studies suggest that for receptors containing identical binding pocket residues, the binding selectivity may be influenced in an allosteric manner by surrounding residues, like those of the extracellular loops (ECLs) that form the vestibule. Exploiting these allosteric influences may facilitate the development of more subtype-selective ligands for GPCRs.",

    "abstract": "In bacteria, the most prevalent receptor proteins of 3',5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP) and 3',5'-cyclic GMP (cGMP) are found among transcription factors of the Crp-Fnr superfamily. The prototypic Escherichia coli catabolite activator protein (CAP) represents the main Crp cluster of this superfamily and is known to bind cAMP and cGMP but to mediate transcription activation only in its cAMP-bound state. In contrast, both cyclic nucleotides mediate transcription activation by Sinorhizobium meliloti Clr, mapping to cluster G of Crp-like proteins. We present crystal structures of Clr-cAMP and Clr-cGMP bound to the core motif of the palindromic Clr DNA binding site (CBS). We show that both cyclic nucleotides shift ternary Clr-cNMP-CBS-DNA complexes (where cNMP is cyclic nucleotide monophosphate) to almost identical active conformations, unlike the situation known for the E. coli CAP-cNMP complex. Isothermal titration calorimetry measured similar affinities of cAMP and cGMP binding to Clr in the presence of CBS core motif DNA (equilibrium dissociation constant for cNMP (<i>K<sub>D</sub></i><sup>cNMP</sup>], ~7 to 11\u2009\u03bcM). However, different affinities were determined in the absence of this DNA (<i>K<sub>D</sub></i><sup>cGMP</sup>, ~24\u2009\u03bcM; <i>K<sub>D</sub></i><sup>cAMP</sup>, ~6\u2009\u03bcM). Sequencing of Clr-coimmunoprecipitated DNA as well as electrophoretic mobility shift and promoter-probe assays expanded the list of experimentally proven Clr-regulated promoters and CBS. This comprehensive set of CBS features conserved nucleobases that are consistent with the sequence readout through interactions of Clr amino acid residues with these nucleobases, as revealed by the Clr-cNMP-CBS-DNA crystal structures. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Cyclic 3',5'-AMP (cAMP) and cyclic 3',5'-GMP (cGMP) are both long known as important nucleotide secondary messengers in eukaryotes. This is also the case for cAMP in prokaryotes, whereas a signaling role for cGMP in this domain of life has been recognized only recently. Catabolite repressor proteins (CRPs) are the most ubiquitous bacterial cAMP receptor proteins. Escherichia coli CAP, the prototypic transcription regulator of the main Crp cluster, binds both cyclic mononucleotides, but only the CAP-cAMP complex promotes transcription activation. In contrast, Crp cluster G proteins studied so far are activated by cGMP or by both cAMP and cGMP. Here, we report a structural analysis of the cAMP- and cGMP-activatable cluster G member Clr from Sinorhizobium meliloti, how binding of cAMP and cGMP shifts Clr to its active conformation, and the structural basis of its DNA binding site specificity.",

    "abstract": "As an adaptation for survival during infection, <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> becomes dormant, reducing its metabolism and growth. Two types of citrate synthases have been identified in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, GltA2 and CitA. Previous work shows that overexpression of CitA, the secondary citrate synthase, stimulates the growth of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> under hypoxic conditions without showing accumulation of triacylglycerols and makes mycobacteria more sensitive to antibiotics, suggesting that CitA may play a role as a metabolic switch during infection and may be an interesting TB drug target. To assess the druggability and possible mechanisms of targeting CitA with small-molecule compounds, the CitA crystal structure was solved to 2.1 \u00c5 by X-ray crystallography. The solved structure shows that CitA lacks an NADH binding site that would afford allosteric regulation, which is atypical of most citrate synthases. However, a pyruvate molecule is observed within the analogous domain, suggesting pyruvate may instead be the allosteric regulator for CitA. The R149 and R153 residues forming the charged portion of the pyruvate binding pocket were mutated to glutamate and methionine, respectively, to assess the effect of mutations on activity. Protein thermal shift assay shows thermal stabilization of CitA in the presence of pyruvate compared to the two CitA variants designed to decrease pyruvate affinity. Solved crystal structures of both variants show no significant structural changes. However, the catalytic efficiency of the R153M variant increases by 2.6-fold. Additionally, we show that covalent modification of C143 of CitA by Ebselen completely arrests enzyme activity. Similar inhibition is observed using two spirocyclic Michael acceptor containing compounds, which inhibit CitA with IC<sup>app</sup><sub>50</sub> values of 6.6 and 10.9 \u03bcM. A crystal structure of CitA modified by Ebselen was solved, but significant structural changes were lacking. Considering that covalent modification of C143 inactivates CitA and the proximity of C143 to the pyruvate binding site, this suggests that structural and/or chemical changes in this sub-domain are responsible for regulating CitA enzymatic activity.",

    "abstract": "The recently discovered metagenomic-derived polyester hydrolase PHL7 is able to efficiently degrade amorphous polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in post-consumer plastic waste. We present the cocrystal structure of this hydrolase with its hydrolysis product terephthalic acid and elucidate the influence of 17 single mutations on the PET-hydrolytic activity and thermal stability of PHL7. The substrate-binding mode of terephthalic acid is similar to that of the thermophilic polyester hydrolase LCC and deviates from the mesophilic IsPETase. The subsite I modifications L93F and Q95Y, derived from LCC, increased the thermal stability, while exchange of H185S, derived from IsPETase, reduced the stability of PHL7. The subsite II residue H130 is suggested to represent an adaptation for high thermal stability, whereas L210 emerged as the main contributor to the observed high PET-hydrolytic activity. Variant L210T showed significantly higher activity, achieving a degradation rate of 20\u2009\u00b5m\u2009h<sup>-1</sup> with amorphous PET films.",

We performed a structure-function analysis of BIRC6 in complex with caspase-9, HTRA2, SMAC, and LC3B, which are critical apoptosis and autophagy proteins. Cryo-electron microscopy structures showed that BIRC6 forms a megadalton crescent shape that arcs around a spacious cavity containing receptor sites for client proteins.

    "abstract": "Highly specific interactions between proteins are a fundamental prerequisite for life, but how they evolve remains an unsolved problem. In particular, interactions between initially unrelated proteins require that they evolve matching surfaces. It is unclear whether such surface compatibilities can only be built by selection in small incremental steps, or whether they can also emerge fortuitously. Here, we used molecular phylogenetics, ancestral sequence reconstruction and biophysical characterization of resurrected proteins to retrace the evolution of an allosteric interaction between two proteins that act in the cyanobacterial photoprotection system. We show that this interaction between the orange carotenoid protein (OCP) and its unrelated regulator, the fluorescence recovery protein (FRP), evolved when a precursor of FRP was horizontally acquired by cyanobacteria. FRP's precursors could already interact with and regulate OCP even before these proteins first encountered each other in an ancestral cyanobacterium. The OCP-FRP interaction exploits an ancient dimer interface in OCP, which also predates the recruitment of FRP into the photoprotection system. Together, our work shows how evolution can fashion complex regulatory systems easily out of pre-existing components.",

    "abstract": "We present crystal structures of a new NAD+-binding riboswitch termed NAD+-II, bound to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and nicotinamide riboside (NR). The RNA structure comprises a number of structural features including three helices, one of which forms a triple helix by interacting with an A5 strand in its minor-groove, and another formed from a long-range pseudoknot. The core of the structure (centrally located and coaxial with the triplex and the pseudoknot) includes two consecutive quadruple base interactions. Unusually the riboswitch binds two molecules of ligand, bound at distinct, non-overlapping sites in the RNA. Binding occurs primarily through the nicotinamide moiety of each ligand, held by specific hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions with the pyridyl ring. The mode of binding is the same for NMN, NR and the nicotinamide moiety of NAD+. In addition, when NAD+ is bound into one site it adopts an elongated conformation such that its diphosphate linker occupies a groove on the surface of the RNA, following which the adenine portion inserts into a pocket and makes specific hydrogen bonding interactions. Thus the NAD+-II riboswitch is distinct from the NAD+-I riboswitch in that it binds two molecules of ligand at separate sites, and that binding occurs principally through the nicotinamide moiety.",

GR agonists are widely prescribed to people with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Here we present high-resolution, multidomain structures of GR in complex with ligand, DNA and co-regulator peptide. The structures reveal how the receptor forms an asymmetric dimer on the DNA and provide a detailed view of the domain interactions within and across the two monomers. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange and DNA-binding experiments demonstrate that ligand-dependent structural changes are communicated across the different domains in the full-length receptor. This study demonstrates how GR forms a distinct architecture on DNA and how signal transmission can be modulated by the ligand pharmacophore, provides a platform to build a new level of understanding of how receptor modifications can drive disease progression and offers key insight for future drug design.",

    "abstract": "Leptin is an adipocyte-derived protein hormone that promotes satiety and energy homeostasis by activating the leptin receptor (LepR)-STAT3 signaling axis in a subset of hypothalamic neurons. Leptin signaling is dysregulated in obesity, however, where appetite remains elevated despite high levels of circulating leptin. To gain insight into the mechanism of leptin receptor activation, here we determine the structure of a stabilized leptin-bound LepR signaling complex using single particle cryo-EM. The structure reveals an asymmetric architecture in which a single leptin induces LepR dimerization via two distinct receptor-binding sites. Analysis of the leptin-LepR binding interfaces reveals the molecular basis for human obesity-associated mutations. Structure-based design of leptin variants that destabilize the asymmetric LepR dimer yield both partial and biased agonists that partially suppress STAT3 activation in the presence of wild-type leptin and decouple activation of STAT3 from LepR negative regulators. Together, these results reveal the structural basis for LepR activation and provide insights into the differential plasticity of signaling pathways downstream of LepR.",

    "abstract": "Gain-of-function mutations in voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 cause severe inherited pain syndromes, including inherited erythromelalgia (IEM). The structural basis of these disease mutations, however, remains elusive. Here, we focused on three mutations that all substitute threonine residues in the alpha-helical S4-S5 intracellular linker that connects the voltage sensor to the pore: Na<sub>V</sub>1.7/I234T, Na<sub>V</sub>1.7/I848T, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.7/S241T in order of their positions in the amino acid sequence within the S4-S5 linkers. Introduction of these IEM mutations into the ancestral bacterial sodium channel Na<sub>V</sub>Ab recapitulated the pathogenic gain-of-function of these mutants by inducing a negative shift in the voltage dependence of activation and slowing the kinetics of inactivation. Remarkably, our structural analysis reveals a common mechanism of action among the three mutations, in which the mutant threonine residues create new hydrogen bonds between the S4-S5 linker and the pore-lining S5 or S6 segment in the pore module. Because the S4-S5 linkers couple voltage sensor movements to pore opening, these newly formed hydrogen bonds would stabilize the activated state substantially and thereby promote the 8 to 18 mV negative shift in the voltage dependence of activation that is characteristic of the Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 IEM mutants. Our results provide key structural insights into how IEM mutations in the S4-S5 linkers may cause hyperexcitability of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 and lead to severe pain in this debilitating disease.",

    "abstract": "The voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>V</sub>) channel Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 has been identified as a potential novel analgesic target due to its involvement in human pain syndromes. However, clinically available Na<sub>V</sub> channel-blocking drugs are not selective among the nine Na<sub>V</sub> channel subtypes, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1-Na<sub>V</sub>1.9. Moreover, the two currently known classes of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 subtype-selective inhibitors (aryl- and acylsulfonamides) have undesirable characteristics that may limit their development. To this point understanding of the structure-activity relationships of the acylsulfonamide class of Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 inhibitors, exemplified by the clinical development candidate <b>GDC-0310</b>, has been based solely on a single co-crystal structure of an arylsulfonamide inhibitor bound to voltage-sensing domain 4 (VSD4). To advance inhibitor design targeting the Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 channel, we pursued high-resolution ligand-bound Na<sub>V</sub>1.7-VSD4 structures using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Here, we report that <b>GDC-0310</b> engages the Na<sub>V</sub>1.7-VSD4 through an unexpected binding mode orthogonal to the arylsulfonamide inhibitor class binding pose, which identifies a previously unknown ligand binding site in Na<sub>V</sub> channels. This finding enabled the design of a novel hybrid inhibitor series that bridges the aryl- and acylsulfonamide binding pockets and allows for the generation of molecules with substantially differentiated structures and properties. Overall, our study highlights the power of cryo-EM methods to pursue challenging drug targets using iterative and high-resolution structure-guided inhibitor design. This work also underscores an important role of the membrane bilayer in the optimization of selective Na<sub>V</sub> channel modulators targeting VSD4.",

    "abstract": "To infect plants, pathogenic fungi secrete small proteins called effectors. Here, we describe the catalytic activity and potential virulence function of the Nudix hydrolase effector AvrM14 from the flax rust fungus (Melampsora lini). We completed extensive in\u00a0vitro assays to characterise the enzymatic activity of the AvrM14 effector. Additionally, we used in planta transient expression of wild-type and catalytically dead AvrM14 versions followed by biochemical assays, phenotypic analysis and RNA sequencing to unravel how the catalytic activity of AvrM14 impacts plant immunity. AvrM14 is an extremely selective enzyme capable of removing the protective 5' cap from mRNA transcripts in\u00a0vitro. Homodimerisation of AvrM14 promoted biologically relevant mRNA cap cleavage in\u00a0vitro and this activity was conserved in related effectors from other Melampsora spp. In planta expression of wild-type AvrM14, but not the catalytically dead version, suppressed immune-related reactive oxygen species production, altered the abundance of some circadian-rhythm-associated mRNA transcripts and reduced the hypersensitive cell-death response triggered by the flax disease resistance protein M1. To date, the decapping of host mRNA as a virulence strategy has not been described beyond viruses. Our results indicate that some fungal pathogens produce Nudix hydrolase effectors with in\u00a0vitro mRNA-decapping activity capable of interfering with plant immunity.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial transcription initiation requires \u03c3 factors for nucleation of the transcription bubble. The canonical housekeeping \u03c3 factor, \u03c3<sup>70</sup>, nucleates DNA melting via recognition of conserved bases of the promoter -10 motif, which are unstacked and captured in pockets of \u03c3<sup>70</sup>. By contrast, the mechanism of transcription bubble nucleation and formation during the unrelated \u03c3<sup>N</sup>-mediated transcription initiation is poorly understood. Herein, we combine structural and biochemical approaches to establish that \u03c3<sup>N</sup>, like \u03c3<sup>70</sup>, captures a flipped, unstacked base in a pocket formed between its N-terminal region I (RI) and extra-long helix features. Strikingly, RI\u00a0inserts into the nascent bubble to stabilize the nucleated bubble prior to engagement of the obligate ATPase activator. Our data suggest a general paradigm of transcription initiation that requires \u03c3 factors to nucleate an early melted intermediate prior to productive RNA synthesis.",

The majority of tailed phages bear a long flexible tail (<i>Siphoviridae</i>) at the tip of which receptor binding proteins (RBPs) specifically interact with their host, triggering infection. In siphophage T5, the unique RBP is located at the extremity of a central fiber. We present the structures of T5 tail tip, determined by cryo-electron microscopy before and after interaction with its <i>E. coli</i> receptor, FhuA, reconstituted into nanodisc. These structures bring out the important conformational changes undergone by T5 tail tip upon infection, which include bending of T5 central fiber on the side of the tail tip, tail anchoring to the membrane, tail tube opening, and formation of a transmembrane channel. The data allow to detail the first steps of an otherwise undescribed infection mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Pain therapy has remained conceptually stagnant since the opioid crisis, which highlighted the dangers of treating pain with opioids. An alternative addiction-free strategy to conventional painkiller-based treatment is targeting receptors at the origin of the pain pathway, such as transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels. Thus, a founding member of the vanilloid subfamily of TRP channels, TRPV1, represents one of the most sought-after pain therapy targets. The need for selective TRPV1 inhibitors extends beyond pain treatment, to other diseases associated with this channel, including psychiatric disorders. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of human TRPV1 in the apo state and in complex with the TRPV1-specific nanomolar-affinity analgesic antagonist SB-366791. SB-366791 binds to the vanilloid site and acts as an allosteric hTRPV1 inhibitor. SB-366791 binding site is supported by mutagenesis combined with electrophysiological recordings and can be further explored to design new drugs targeting TRPV1 in disease conditions.",

    "abstract": "The FimH type-1 fimbrial adhesin allows pathogenic Escherichia coli to adhere to glycoproteins in the epithelial linings of human bladder and intestinal tract, by using multiple fimbriae simultaneously. Pauci- and high-mannose type N-glycans are natural FimH receptors on those glycoproteins. Oligomannose-3 and oligomannose-5 bind with the highest affinity to FimH by using the same Man\u03b11,3Man branch. Oligomannose-6 is generated from oligomannose-5 in the next step of the biogenesis of high-mannose N-glycans, by the transfer of a mannose in \u03b11,2-linkage onto this branch. Using serial crystallography and by measuring the kinetics of binding, we demonstrate that shielding the high-affinity epitope drives the binding of multiple FimH molecules. First, we profiled FimH glycan binding on a microarray containing paucimannosidic N-glycans and in a FimH LEctPROFILE assay. To make the transition to oligomannose-6, we measured the kinetics of FimH binding using paucimannosidic N-glycans, glycoproteins and all four \u03b1-dimannosides conjugated to bovine serum albumin. Equimolar mixed interfaces of the dimannosides present in oligomannose-6 and molecular dynamics simulations suggest a positive cooperativity in the bivalent binding of Man\u03b11,3Man\u03b11 and Man\u03b11,6Man\u03b11 dimannosides. The binding of core \u03b11,6-fucosylated oligomannose-3 in cocrystals of FimH is monovalent but interestingly the GlcNAc1-Fuc moiety retains highly flexibility. In cocrystals with oligomannose-6, two FimH bacterial adhesins bind the Man\u03b11,3Man\u03b11 and Man\u03b11,6Man\u03b11 endings of the second trimannose core (A-4'-B). This cooperative switch towards bivalent binding appears sustainable beyond a molar excess of oligomannose-6. Our findings provide important novel structural insights for the design of multivalent FimH antagonists that bind with positive cooperativity.",

    "abstract": "Catching the structure of cytochrome\u2005P450 enzymes in flagrante is crucial for the development of P450 biocatalysts, as most structures collected are found trapped in a precatalytic conformation. At the heart of P450 catalysis lies Cpd\u2009I, a short-lived, highly reactive intermediate, whose recalcitrant nature has thwarted most attempts at capturing catalytically relevant poses of P450s. We report the crystal structure of P450BM3 mimicking the state in the precise moment preceding epoxidation, which is in perfect agreement with the experimentally observed stereoselectivity. This structure was attained by incorporation of the stable Cpd\u2009I mimic oxomolybdenum mesoporphyrin IX into P450BM3 in the presence of styrene. The orientation of styrene to the Mo-oxo species in the crystal structures sheds light onto the dynamics involved in the rotation of styrene to present its vinyl group to Cpd\u2009I. This method serves as a powerful tool for predicting and modelling the stereoselectivity of P450 reactions.",

    "abstract": "Mutations of the androgen receptor (AR) associated with prostate cancer and androgen insensitivity syndrome may profoundly influence its structure, protein interaction network, and binding to chromatin, resulting in altered transcription signatures and drug responses. Current structural information fails to explain the effect of pathological mutations on AR structure-function relationship. Here, we have thoroughly studied the effects of selected mutations that span the complete dimer interface of AR ligand-binding domain (AR-LBD) using x-ray crystallography in combination with in vitro, in silico, and cell-based assays. We show that these variants alter AR-dependent transcription and responses to anti-androgens by inducing a previously undescribed allosteric switch in the AR-LBD that increases exposure of a major methylation target, Arg<sup>761</sup>. We also corroborate the relevance of residues Arg<sup>761</sup> and Tyr<sup>764</sup> for AR dimerization and function. Together, our results reveal allosteric coupling of AR dimerization and posttranslational modifications as a disease mechanism with implications for precision medicine.",

The Cu<sup>2+</sup>-H52A/H58E variant catalyzed the stereoselective Michael addition reaction and was found to bear a flexible metal-binding site in the high-resolution crystal structure. Furthermore, the H52A/H58E/F104W mutant accommodated a water molecule, which was supported by Glu58 and Trp104 residues <i>via</i> hydrogen bonding, presumably leading to high stereoselectivity. Thus, the 2-His-1-carboxylate facial triad was confirmed to be a versatile and promising metal-binding motif for abiological and canonical biological reactions.",

    "abstract": "Small beta barrel proteins are attractive targets for computational design because of their considerable functional diversity despite their very small size (<70 amino acids). However, there are considerable challenges to designing such structures, and there has been little success thus far. Because of the small size, the hydrophobic core stabilizing the fold is necessarily very small, and the conformational strain of barrel closure can oppose folding; also intermolecular aggregation through free beta strand edges can compete with proper monomer folding. Here, we explore the de novo design of small beta barrel topologies using both Rosetta energy-based methods and deep learning approaches to design four small beta barrel folds: Src homology 3 (SH3) and oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) topologies found in nature and five and six up-and-down-stranded barrels rarely if ever seen in nature. Both approaches yielded successful designs with high thermal stability and experimentally determined structures with less than 2.4 \u00c5 rmsd from the designed models. Using deep learning for backbone generation and Rosetta for sequence design yielded higher design success rates and increased structural diversity than Rosetta alone. The ability to design a large and structurally diverse set of small beta barrel proteins greatly increases the protein shape space available for designing binders to protein targets of interest.",

    "abstract": "Strategies to activate abscisic acid (ABA) receptors and boost ABA signaling by small molecules that act as ABA receptor agonists are promising biotechnological tools to enhance plant drought tolerance. Protein structures of crop ABA receptors might require modifications to improve recognition of chemical ligands, which in turn can be optimized by structural information. Through structure-based targeted design, we have combined chemical and genetic approaches to generate an ABA receptor agonist molecule (iSB09) and engineer a CsPYL1 ABA receptor, named CsPYL1<sup>5m</sup>, which efficiently binds iSB09. This optimized receptor-agonist pair leads to activation of ABA signaling and marked drought tolerance. No constitutive activation of ABA signaling and hence growth penalty was observed in transformed <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> plants. Therefore, conditional and efficient activation of ABA signaling was achieved through a chemical-genetic orthogonal approach based on iterative cycles of ligand and receptor optimization driven by the structure of ternary receptor-ligand-phosphatase complexes.",

While CIS are highly abundant across diverse bacterial phyla, representative gene clusters in Gram-positive organisms remain poorly studied. Here we characterize a CIS in the Gram-positive multicellular model organism Streptomyces coelicolor and show that, in contrast to most other CIS, S. coelicolor CIS (CIS<sup>Sc</sup>) mediate cell death in response to stress and impact cellular development. CIS<sup>Sc</sup> are expressed in the cytoplasm of vegetative hyphae and are not released into the medium. Our cryo-electron microscopy structure enabled the engineering of non-contractile and fluorescently tagged CIS<sup>Sc</sup> assemblies. Cryo-electron tomography showed that CIS<sup>Sc</sup> contraction is linked to reduced cellular integrity. Fluorescence light microscopy furthermore revealed that functional CIS<sup>Sc</sup> mediate cell death upon encountering different types of stress. The absence of functional CIS<sup>Sc</sup> had an impact on hyphal differentiation and secondary metabolite production. Finally, we identified three putative effector proteins, which when absent, phenocopied other CIS<sup>Sc</sup> mutants. Our results provide new functional insights into CIS in Gram-positive organisms and a framework for studying novel intracellular roles, including regulated cell death and life-cycle progression in multicellular bacteria.",

The activities of BCL6 are dependent on protein-protein interactions with transcriptional co-repressors. To find new therapeutic interventions addressing the needs of patients with DLBCL, we initiated a program to identify BCL6 inhibitors that interfere with co-repressor binding. A virtual screen hit with binding activity in the high micromolar range was optimized by structure-guided methods, resulting in a novel and highly potent inhibitor series. Further optimization resulted in the lead candidate <b>58</b> (OICR12694/JNJ-65234637), a BCL6 inhibitor with low nanomolar DLBCL cell growth inhibition and an excellent oral pharmacokinetic profile. Based on its overall favorable preclinical profile, OICR12694 is a highly potent, orally bioavailable candidate for testing BCL6 inhibition in DLBCL and other neoplasms, particularly in combination with other therapies.",

    "abstract": "Metal ion-nucleic acid interactions contribute significantly to nucleic acid structure and biological activity and have potential applications in nanotechnology. Hg<sup>2+</sup> specifically binds to the natural T-T mismatched base pair in duplex DNA to form a T-Hg-T base pair. Metal ions may enhance DNA damage induced by DNA-damaging agents, such as oxidative agents. The interactions between metal ions and damaged DNAs, such as mismatched oxidized bases, have not been well characterized. Here, we examined the possibility of Hg<sup>2+</sup> binding to an asymmetric mismatched base pair involving thymine and 5-hydroxyuracil (OHdU), an oxidized base produced by the oxidative deamination of cytosine. UV melting analyses showed that only the melting temperature of the single T-OHdU mismatched duplex DNA increased upon Hg<sup>2+</sup> addition. CD spectra indicated no significant change in the higher-order structure of the single T-OHdU mismatched duplex DNA upon Hg<sup>2+</sup> addition. X-ray crystallographic structure with two consecutive T-OHdU mismatched base pairs and isothermal titration calorimetric analyses with the single T-OHdU mismatched base pair showed that Hg<sup>2+</sup> specifically binds to the N3 positions of both T and OHdU in T-OHdU at 1:1 molar ratio, with a 5\u00d710<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> binding constant of to form the T-Hg-OHdU base pair. The Hg<sup>2+</sup>-bound structure and the Hg<sup>2+</sup>-binding affinity for T-OHdU was similar to those for T-T. This study on T-Hg-OHdU metal-mediated base pair could aid in studying the molecular mechanism of metal ion-mediated DNA damage and their potential applications in nanotechnology.",

    "abstract": "Active DNA demethylation plays a crucial role in eukaryotic gene imprinting and antagonizing DNA methylation. The plant-specific REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 1/DEMETER (ROS1/DME) family of enzymes directly excise 5-methyl-cytosine (5mC), representing an efficient DNA demethylation pathway distinct from that of animals. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of an Arabidopsis ROS1 catalytic fragment in complex with substrate DNA, mismatch DNA and reaction intermediate, respectively. The substrate 5mC is flipped-out from the DNA duplex and subsequently recognized by the ROS1 base-binding pocket through hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions towards the 5-methyl group and Watson-Crick edge respectively, while the different protonation states of the bases determine the substrate preference for 5mC over T:G mismatch. Together with the structure of the reaction intermediate complex, our structural and biochemical studies revealed the molecular basis for substrate specificity, as well as the reaction mechanism underlying 5mC demethylation by the ROS1/DME family of plant-specific DNA demethylases.",

MIs are under development as alternative drugs to augment current antiretroviral therapies. Although promising, their mechanism of action and associated virus resistance pathways remain poorly understood at the molecular, biochemical, and structural levels. We report atomic-resolution magic-angle-spinning NMR structures of microcrystalline assemblies of CA<sub>CTD</sub>-SP1 complexed with BVM and/or the assembly cofactor inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6). Our results reveal a mechanism by which BVM disrupts maturation, tightening the 6-helix bundle pore and quenching the motions of SP1 and the simultaneously bound IP6. In addition, BVM-resistant SP1-A1V and SP1-V7A variants exhibit distinct conformational and binding characteristics. Taken together, our study provides a structural explanation for BVM resistance as well as guidance for the design of new MIs.",

    "abstract": "PsEst3, a psychrophilic esterase obtained from Paenibacillus sp. R4, which was isolated from the permafrost of Alaska, exhibits relatively high activity at low temperatures. Here, crystal structures of PsEst3 complexed with various ligands were generated and studied at atomic resolution, and biochemical studies were performed to analyze the structure-function relationship of PsEst3. Certain unique characteristics of PsEst3 distinct from those of other classes of lipases/esterases were identified. Firstly, PsEst3 contains a conserved GHSRA/G pentapeptide sequence in the GxSxG motif around the nucleophilic serine. Additionally, it contains a conserved HGFR/K consensus sequence in the oxyanion hole, which is distinct from that in other lipase/esterase families, as well as a specific domain composition (for example a helix-turn-helix motif) and a degenerative lid domain that exposes the active site to the solvent. Secondly, the electrostatic potential of the active site in PsEst3 is positive, which may cause unintended binding of negatively charged chemicals in the active site. Thirdly, the last residue of the oxyanion hole-forming sequence, Arg44, separates the active site from the solvent by sealing the acyl-binding pocket, suggesting that PsEst3 is an enzyme that is customized to sense an unidentified substrate that is distinct from those of classical lipases/esterases. Collectively, this evidence strongly suggests that PsEst3 belongs to a distinct family of esterases.",

All known tRNAs are heavily modified at multiple positions through post-transcriptional addition of chemical groups. Modifications in the tRNA anticodons are directly influencing ribosome decoding and dynamics during translation elongation and are crucial for maintaining proteome integrity. In eukaryotes, wobble uridines are modified by Elongator, a large and highly conserved macromolecular complex. Elongator consists of two subcomplexes, namely Elp123 containing the enzymatically active Elp3 subunit and the associated Elp456 hetero-hexamer. The structure of the fully assembled complex and the function of the Elp456 subcomplex have remained elusive. Here, we show the cryo-electron microscopy structure of yeast Elongator at an overall resolution of 4.3 \u00c5. We validate the obtained structure by complementary mutational analyses in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we determined various structures of the murine Elongator complex, including the fully assembled mouse Elongator complex at 5.9 \u00c5 resolution. Our results confirm the structural conservation of Elongator and its intermediates among eukaryotes. Furthermore, we complement our analyses with the biochemical characterization of the assembled human Elongator. Our results provide the molecular basis for the assembly of Elongator and its tRNA modification activity in eukaryotes.",

Crystals of selenomethionine-labeled RutB were produced, which allowed us to determine the first structure of the enzyme at a resolution of 1.9 \u00c5 and to identify it as a new member of the isochorismatase-like hydrolase family. RutB was co-crystallized with the substrate analogue ureidopropionate, revealing the mode of substrate binding. Mutation of residues constituting the catalytic triad (D24A, D24N, K133A, C166A, C166S, C166T, C166Y) resulted in complete inactivation of RutB, whereas mutation of other residues close to the active site (Y29F, Y35F, N72A, W74A, W74F, E80A, E80D, S92A, S92T, S92Y, Q105A, Y136A, Y136F) leads to distinct changes of the turnover number (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>) and/or the Michaelis constant (<i>K</i><sub>M</sub>).

Here, we report the discovery of a series of macrolides called sequanamycins with outstanding in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Sequanamycins are bacterial ribosome inhibitors that interact with the ribosome in a similar manner to classic macrolides like erythromycin and clarithromycin, but with binding characteristics that allow them to overcome the inherent macrolide resistance of Mtb. Structures of the ribosome with bound inhibitors were used to optimize sequanamycin to produce the advanced lead compound SEQ-9. SEQ-9 was efficacious in mouse models of acute and chronic TB as a single agent, and it demonstrated bactericidal activity in a murine TB infection model in combination with other TB drugs. These results support further investigation of this series as TB clinical candidates, with the potential for use in new regimens against drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB.",

    "abstract": "Influenza is one of the leading causes of disease-related mortalities worldwide. Several strategies have been implemented during the past decades to hinder the replication cycle of influenza viruses, all of which have resulted in the emergence of resistant virus strains. The most recent example is baloxavir marboxil, where a single mutation in the active site of the target endonuclease domain of the RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase renders the recent FDA approved compound \u223c1000-fold less effective. Raltegravir is a first-in-class HIV inhibitor that shows modest activity to the endonuclease. Here, we have used structure-guided approaches to create rationally designed derivative molecules that efficiently engage the endonuclease active site. The design strategy was driven by our previously published structures of endonuclease-substrate complexes, which allowed us to target functionally conserved residues and reduce the likelihood of resistance mutations. We succeeded in developing low nanomolar equipotent inhibitors of both wild-type and baloxavir-resistant endonuclease. We also developed macrocyclic versions of these inhibitors that engage the active site in the same manner as their 'open' counterparts but with reduced affinity. Structural analyses provide clear avenues for how to increase the affinity of these cyclic compounds.",

    "abstract": "The \u03b1-helix is one of the most common protein surface recognition motifs found in nature, and its unique amide-cloaking properties also enable \u03b1-helical polypeptide motifs to exist in membranes. Together, these properties have inspired the development of \u03b1-helically constrained (Helicon) therapeutics that can enter cells and bind targets that have been considered \"undruggable\", such as protein-protein interactions. To date, no general method for discovering \u03b1-helical binders to proteins has been reported, limiting Helicon drug discovery to only those proteins with previously characterized \u03b1-helix recognition sites, and restricting the starting chemical matter to those known \u03b1-helical binders. Here, we report a general and rapid screening method to empirically map the \u03b1-helix binding sites on a broad range of target proteins in parallel using large, unbiased Helicon phage display libraries and next-generation sequencing. We apply this method to screen six structurally diverse protein domains, only one of which had been previously reported to bind isolated \u03b1-helical peptides, discovering 20 families that collectively comprise several hundred individual Helicons. Analysis of 14 X-ray cocrystal structures reveals at least nine distinct \u03b1-helix recognition sites across these six proteins, and biochemical and biophysical studies show that these Helicons can block protein-protein interactions, inhibit enzymatic activity, induce conformational rearrangements, and cause protein dimerization. We anticipate that this method will prove broadly useful for the study of protein recognition and for the development of both biochemical tools and therapeutics for traditionally challenging protein targets.",

The endoplasmic reticulum quality control (ERQC) enzyme \u03b1-glucosidase I (\u03b1-GluI) is an attractive target for developing broad-spectrum antivirals. We synthesized 28 inhibitors designed to interact with all four subsites of the \u03b1-GluI active site. These inhibitors are derivatives of the iminosugars 1-deoxynojirimycin (1-DNJ) and valiolamine. Crystal structures of ER \u03b1-GluI bound to 25 1-DNJ and three valiolamine derivatives revealed the basis for inhibitory potency. We established the structure-activity relationship (SAR) and used the Site Identification by Ligand Competitive Saturation (SILCS) method to develop a model for predicting \u03b1-GluI inhibition. We screened the compounds against SARS-CoV-2 <i>in vitro</i> to identify those with greater antiviral activity than the benchmark \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitor UV-4. These host-targeting compounds are candidates for investigation in animal models of SARS-CoV-2 and for testing against other viruses that rely on ERQC for correct glycoprotein folding.",

    "abstract": "The VanRS two-component system regulates the resistance phenotype of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. VanS is a sensor histidine kinase that responds to the presence of vancomycin by autophosphorylating and subsequently transferring the phosphoryl group to the response regulator, VanR. The phosphotransfer activates VanR as a transcription factor, which initiates the expression of resistance genes. Structural information about VanS proteins has remained elusive, hindering the molecular-level understanding of their function. Here, we present X-ray crystal structures for the catalytic and ATP-binding (CA) domains of two VanS proteins, derived from vancomycin-resistant enterococci types A and C. Both proteins adopt the canonical Bergerat fold that has been observed for CA domains of other prokaryotic histidine kinases. We attempted to determine structures for the nucleotide-bound forms of both proteins; however, despite repeated efforts, these forms could not be crystallized, prompting us to measure the proteins' binding affinities for ATP. Unexpectedly, both CA domains displayed low affinities for the nucleotide, with K<sub>D</sub> values in the low millimolar range. Since these K<sub>D</sub> values are comparable to intracellular ATP concentrations, this weak substrate binding could reflect a way of regulating expression of the resistance phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Transcription termination is an essential step in transcription by RNA polymerase (RNAP) and crucial for gene regulation. For many bacterial genes, transcription termination is mediated by the adenosine triphosphate-dependent RNA translocase/helicase Rho, which causes RNA/DNA dissociation from the RNAP elongation complex (EC). However, the structural basis of the interplay between Rho and RNAP remains obscure. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the <i>Thermus thermophilus</i> RNAP EC engaged with Rho. The Rho hexamer binds RNAP through the carboxyl-terminal domains, which surround the RNA exit site of RNAP, directing the nascent RNA seamlessly from the RNA exit to its central channel. The \u03b2-flap tip at the RNA exit is critical for the Rho-dependent RNA release, and its deletion causes an alternative Rho-RNAP binding mode, which is irrelevant to termination. The Rho binding site overlaps with the binding sites of other macromolecules, such as ribosomes, providing a general basis of gene regulation.",

PRPS is a key regulator of nucleotide metabolism, and mutations in the human enzyme PRPS1 lead to a spectrum of diseases. Here we determine structures of human PRPS1 filaments in active and inhibited states, with fixed assembly contacts accommodating both conformations. The conserved assembly interface stabilizes the binding site for the essential activator phosphate, increasing activity in the filament. Some disease mutations alter assembly, supporting the link between filament stability and activity. Structures of active PRPS1 filaments turning over substrate also reveal coupling of catalysis in one active site with product release in an adjacent site. PRPS1 filaments therefore provide an additional layer of allosteric control, conserved throughout evolution, with likely impact on metabolic homeostasis. Stabilization of allosteric binding sites by polymerization adds to the growing diversity of assembly-based enzyme regulatory mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The human AAA+ ATPase CLPB (SKD3) is a protein disaggregase in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) and functions to promote the solubilization of various mitochondrial proteins. Loss-of-function CLPB mutations are associated with a few human diseases with neutropenia and neurological disorders. Unlike canonical AAA+ proteins, CLPB contains a unique ankyrin repeat domain (ANK) at its N-terminus. How CLPB functions as a disaggregase and the role of its ANK domain are currently unclear. Herein, we report a comprehensive structural characterization of human CLPB in both the apo- and substrate-bound states. CLPB assembles into homo-tetradecamers in apo-state and is remodeled into homo-dodecamers upon substrate binding. Conserved pore-loops (PLs) on the ATPase domains form a spiral staircase to grip and translocate the substrate in a step-size of 2 amino acid residues. The ANK domain is not only responsible for maintaining the higher-order assembly but also essential for the disaggregase activity. Interactome analysis suggests that the ANK domain may directly interact with a variety of mitochondrial substrates. These results reveal unique properties of CLPB as a general disaggregase in mitochondria and highlight its potential as a target for the treatment of various mitochondria-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Plants contain rapidly evolving specialized enzymes that support the biosynthesis of functionally diverse natural products. In coumarin biosynthesis, a BAHD acyltransferase-family enzyme COSY was recently discovered to accelerate coumarin formation as the only known BAHD enzyme to catalyze an intramolecular acyl transfer reaction. Here we investigate the structural and mechanistic basis for COSY's coumarin synthase activity. Our structural analyses reveal an unconventional active-site configuration adapted to COSY's specialized activity. Through mutagenesis studies and deuterium exchange experiments, we identify a unique proton exchange mechanism at the \u03b1-carbon of the o-hydroxylated trans-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA substrates during the catalytic cycle of COSY. Quantum mechanical cluster modeling and molecular dynamics further support this key mechanism for lowering the activation energy of the rate-limiting trans-to-cis isomerization step in coumarin production. This study unveils an unconventional catalytic mechanism mediated by a BAHD-family enzyme, and sheds light on COSY's evolutionary origin and its recruitment to coumarin biosynthesis in eudicots.",

Targeted protein degraders have emerged as a promising means of inducing the degradation of disease-implicated proteins by using the endogenous quality control mechanisms of a cell. Here, a series of heterobifunctional degrader candidates targeting hCAII were developed from a simple aryl sulfonamide fragment. Degrader candidates were functionalized to produce either cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRBN) recruiting proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) or adamantyl-based hydrophobic tags (HyTs). Screens in HEK293 cells identified two PROTAC small-molecule degraders of hCA. Optimization of linker length and composition yielded a degrader with sub-nanomolar potency and sustained depletion of hCAII over prolonged treatments. Mechanistic studies suggest that this optimized degrader depletes hCAII through the same mechanism as previously reported CRBN-recruiting heterobifunctional degraders.",

Such polyreactive antibodies compromise screening pipelines, lead to incorrect and irreproducible experimental results, and are generally intractable for clinical development. Here, we design a set of experiments using a diverse na\u00efve synthetic camelid antibody fragment (nanobody) library to enable machine learning models to accurately assess polyreactivity from protein sequence (AUC\u2009>\u20090.8). Moreover, our models provide quantitative scoring metrics that predict the effect of amino acid substitutions on polyreactivity. We experimentally test our models' performance on three independent nanobody scaffolds, where over 90% of predicted substitutions successfully reduced polyreactivity. Importantly, the models allow us to diminish the polyreactivity of an angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist nanobody, without compromising its functional properties. We provide a companion web-server that offers a straightforward means of predicting polyreactivity and polyreactivity-reducing mutations for any given nanobody sequence.",

    "abstract": "Canine distemper virus (CDV) is an enveloped RNA morbillivirus that triggers respiratory, enteric, and high incidence of severe neurological disorders. CDV induces devastating outbreaks in wild and endangered animals as well as in domestic dogs in countries associated with suboptimal vaccination programs. The receptor-binding tetrameric attachment (H)-protein is part of the morbilliviral cell entry machinery. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure and supramolecular organization of the tetrameric CDV H-protein ectodomain. The structure reveals that the morbilliviral H-protein is composed of three main domains: stalk, neck, and heads. The most unexpected feature was the inherent asymmetric architecture of the CDV H-tetramer being shaped by the neck, which folds into an almost 90\u00b0 bent conformation with respect to the stalk. Consequently, two non-contacting receptor-binding H-head dimers, which are also tilted toward each other, are located on one side of an intertwined four helical bundle stalk domain. Positioning of the four protomer polypeptide chains within the neck domain is guided by a glycine residue (G158), which forms a hinge point exclusively in two protomer polypeptide chains. Molecular dynamics simulations validated the stability of the asymmetric structure under near physiological conditions and molecular docking showed that two receptor-binding sites are fully accessible. Thus, this spatial organization of the CDV H-tetramer would allow for concomitant protein interactions with the stalk and head domains without steric clashes. In summary, the structure of the CDV H-protein ectodomain provides new insights into the morbilliviral cell entry system and offers a blueprint for next-generation structure-based antiviral drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Apoptosis is important for development and tissue homeostasis, and its dysregulation can lead to diseases, including cancer. As an apoptotic effector, BAK undergoes conformational changes that promote mitochondrial outer membrane disruption, leading to cell death. This is termed \"activation\" and can be induced by peptides from the human proteins BID, BIM, and PUMA. To identify additional peptides that can regulate BAK, we used computational protein design, yeast surface display screening, and structure-based energy scoring to identify 10 diverse new binders. We discovered peptides from the human proteins BNIP5 and PXT1 and three non-native peptides that activate BAK in liposome assays and induce cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Crystal structures and binding studies reveal a high degree of similarity among peptide activators and inhibitors, ruling out a simple function-determining property. Our results shed light on the vast peptide sequence space that can regulate BAK function and will guide the design of BAK-modulating tools and therapeutics.",

Our cryo-EM analysis demonstrates that the E1P\u00b72Ca<sup>2+</sup> state exists in low abundance and preferentially transitions to an E2P-like structure by releasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> and that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release gate subsequently undergoes stepwise closure during the dephosphorylation processes. Importantly, each intermediate adopts multiple sub-state structures including those like the next one in the catalytic series, indicating conformational overlap at transition steps, as further substantiated by atomistic molecular dynamic simulations of SERCA2b in a lipid bilayer. The present findings provide insight into how enzymes accelerate catalytic cycles.",

    "abstract": "Positive-strand RNA viruses replicate their genomes in virus-induced membrane vesicles, and the resulting RNA replication complexes are a major target for virus control. Nodavirus studies first revealed viral RNA replication proteins forming a 12-fold symmetric \"crown\" at the vesicle opening to the cytosol, an arrangement recently confirmed to extend to distantly related alphaviruses. Using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), we show that mature nodavirus crowns comprise two stacked 12-mer rings of multidomain viral RNA replication protein A. Each ring contains an ~19 nm circle of C-proximal polymerase domains, differentiated by strikingly diverged positions of N-proximal RNA capping/membrane binding domains. The lower ring is a \"proto-crown\" precursor that assembles prior to RNA template recruitment, RNA synthesis, and replication vesicle formation. In this proto-crown, the N-proximal segments interact to form a toroidal central floor, whose 3.1 \u00c5 resolution structure reveals many mechanistic details of the RNA capping/membrane binding domains. In the upper ring, cryo-EM fitting indicates that the N-proximal domains extend radially outside the polymerases, forming separated, membrane-binding \"legs.\" The polymerase and N-proximal domains are connected by a long linker accommodating the conformational switch between the two rings and possibly also polymerase movements associated with RNA synthesis and nonsymmetric electron density in the lower center of mature crowns. The results reveal remarkable viral protein multifunctionality, conformational flexibility, and evolutionary plasticity and insights into (+)RNA virus replication and control.",

    "abstract": "DNA polymerases catalyze DNA synthesis with high efficiency, which is essential for all life. Extensive kinetic and structural efforts have been executed in exploring mechanisms of DNA polymerases, surrounding their kinetic pathway, catalytic mechanisms, and factors that dictate polymerase fidelity. Recent time-resolved crystallography studies on DNA polymerase \u03b7 (Pol \u03b7) and \u03b2 have revealed essential transient events during the DNA synthesis reaction, such as mechanisms of primer deprotonation, separated roles of the three metal ions, and conformational changes that disfavor incorporation of the incorrect substrate. DNA-embedded ribonucleotides (rNs) are the most common lesion on DNA and a major threat to genome integrity. While kinetics of rN incorporation has been explored and structural studies have revealed that DNA polymerases have a steric gate that destabilizes ribonucleotide triphosphate binding, the mechanism of extension upon rN addition remains poorly characterized. Using steady-state kinetics, static and time-resolved X-ray crystallography with Pol \u03b7 as a model system, we showed that the extra hydroxyl group on the primer terminus does alter the dynamics of the polymerase active site as well as the catalysis and fidelity of DNA synthesis. During rN extension, Pol \u03b7 error incorporation efficiency increases significantly across different sequence contexts. Finally, our systematic structural studies suggest that the rN at the primer end improves primer alignment and reduces barriers in C2'-endo to C3'-endo sugar conformational change. Overall, our work provides further mechanistic insights into the effects of rN incorporation on DNA synthesis.",

    "abstract": "BRD4-NUT, a driver fusion mutant in rare and highly aggressive NUT carcinoma, acts in aberrant transcription of anti-differentiation genes by recruiting histone acetyltransferase (HAT) p300 and promoting p300-driven histone hyperacetylation and nuclear condensation in chromatin. However, the molecular basis of how BRD4-NUT recruits and activates p300 remains elusive. Here, we report that BRD4-NUT contains two transactivation domains (TADs) in NUT that bind to the TAZ2 domain in p300. Our NMR structures reveal that NUT TADs adopt amphipathic helices when bound to the four-helical bundle TAZ2 domain. The NUT protein forms liquid-like droplets in-vitro that are enhanced by TAZ2 binding in 1:2 stoichiometry. The TAD/TAZ2 bipartite binding in BRD4-NUT/p300 triggers allosteric activation of p300 and acetylation-driven liquid-like condensation on chromatin that comprise histone H3 lysine 27 and 18 acetylation and transcription proteins BRD4L/S, CDK9, MED1, and RNA polymerase II. The BRD4-NUT/p300 chromatin condensation is key for activating transcription of pro-proliferation genes such as ALX1, resulting ALX1/Snail signaling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Our study provides a previously underappreciated structural mechanism illuminating BRD4-NUT's bipartite p300 recruitment and activation in NUT carcinoma that nucleates a feed-forward loop for propagating histone hyperacetylation and chromatin condensation to sustain aberrant anti-differentiation gene transcription and perpetual tumor cell growth.",

The latter orchestrates a complex antiviral response that is initiated through the synthesis of cyclic oligoadenylates after recognition of foreign RNA<sup>3-5</sup>. Among the large set of proteins that are linked to type\u2009III systems and predicted to bind cyclic oligoadenylates<sup>6,7</sup>, a CRISPR-associated Lon protease (CalpL) stood out to us. CalpL contains a sensor domain of the SAVED family<sup>7</sup> fused to a Lon protease effector domain. However, the mode of action of this effector is unknown. Here we report the structure and function of CalpL and show that this soluble protein forms a stable tripartite complex with two other proteins, CalpT and CalpS, that are encoded on the same operon. After activation by cyclic tetra-adenylate (cA<sub>4</sub>), CalpL oligomerizes and specifically cleaves the MazF homologue CalpT, which releases the extracytoplasmic function \u03c3\u2009factor CalpS from the complex. Our data provide a direct connection between CRISPR-based detection of foreign nucleic acids and transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, the presence of a SAVED domain that binds cyclic tetra-adenylate in a CRISPR effector reveals a link to the cyclic-oligonucleotide-based antiphage signalling system.",

After the genome packaging at near-crystalline densities, the capsid is subjected to a major expansion and stabilization step that allows it to withstand environmental stresses and internal high pressure. Several different mechanisms for stabilizing the capsid have been structurally characterized, but how these mechanisms have evolved is still not understood. Using cryo-EM structure determination of 10 capsids, structural comparisons, phylogenetic analyses, and Alphafold predictions, we have constructed a detailed structural dendrogram describing the evolution of capsid structural stability within the actinobacteriophages. We show that the actinobacteriophage major capsid proteins can be classified into 15 groups based upon their HK97-fold.",

The latter activity provides valuable NDP-furanosyl donors for glycosyltransferases and requires a divalent cation as a cofactor instead of FAD used by UDP-D-galactopyranose mutase. However, details of the mechanism for NDP-pyranose mutase activity are not clear. Here we report the first crystal structures of GT75 family NDP-pyranose mutases. The novel structures of GT75 member MtdL in complex with Mn<sup>2+</sup> and GDP, GDP-D-glucopyranose, GDP-L-fucopyranose, GDP-L-fucofuranose, respectively, combined with site-directed mutagenesis studies, reveal key residues involved in Mn<sup>2+</sup> coordination, substrate binding, and catalytic reactions. We also provide a possible catalytic mechanism for this unique type of NDP-pyranose mutase. Taken together, our results highlight key elements of an enzyme family important for furanose biosynthesis.",

Disrupting the BET family bromodomain acetyl-lysine (KAc) histone protein-protein interaction with small-molecule KAc mimetics has proven to be a disease-relevant mechanism of action, and multiple molecules are currently undergoing oncology clinical trials. This work describes an efficiency analysis of published GSK pan-BET bromodomain inhibitors, which drove a strategic choice to focus on the identification of a ligand-efficient KAc mimetic with the hypothesis that lipophilic efficiency could be drastically improved during optimization. This focus drove the discovery of the highly ligand-efficient and structurally distinct benzoazepinone KAc mimetic. Following crystallography to identify suitable growth vectors, the benzoazepinone core was optimized through an explore-exploit structure-activity relationship (SAR) approach while carefully monitoring lipophilic efficiency to deliver I-BET432 (<b>41</b>) as an oral candidate quality molecule.",

    "abstract": "The cell nucleus is a primary target for intracellular bacterial pathogens to counteract immune responses and hijack host signalling pathways to cause disease. Here we identify two Brucella abortus effectors, NyxA and NyxB, that interfere with host protease SENP3, and this facilitates intracellular replication of the pathogen. The translocated Nyx effectors directly interact with SENP3 via a defined acidic patch (identified from the crystal structure of NyxB), preventing nucleolar localisation of SENP3 at late stages of infection. By sequestering SENP3, the effectors promote cytoplasmic accumulation of nucleolar AAA-ATPase NVL and ribosomal protein L5 (RPL5) in effector-enriched structures in the vicinity of replicating bacteria. The shuttling of ribosomal biogenesis-associated nucleolar proteins is inhibited by SENP3 and requires the autophagy-initiation protein Beclin1 and the SUMO-E3 ligase PIAS3. Our results highlight a nucleomodulatory function of two Brucella effectors and reveal that SENP3 is a crucial regulator of the subcellular localisation of nucleolar proteins during Brucella infection, promoting intracellular replication of the pathogen.",

    "abstract": "DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a multicomponent complex including the DNA-PK catalytic subunit and Ku70/80 heterodimer together with DNA, is central to human DNA damage response and repair. Using a DNA-PK-selective inhibitor (M3814), we identified from one dataset two cryo-EM structures of the human DNA-PK complex in different states, the intermediate state and the active state. Here we show that activation of the kinase is regulated through conformational changes caused by the binding ligand and the string region (residues 802-846) of the DNA-PK catalytic subunit, particularly the helix-hairpin-helix motif (residues 816-836) that interacts with DNA. These observations demonstrate the regulatory role of the ligand and explain why DNA-PK is DNA dependent. Cooperation and coordination among binding partners, disordered flexible regions and mechanically flexible HEAT repeats modulate the activation of the kinase. Together with previous findings, these results provide a better molecular understanding of DNA-PK catalysis.",

    "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most perilous and harmful type of DNA damage and can cause tumorigenesis or cell death if left repaired with an error or unrepaired. RadD, a member of the SF2 family, is a recently discovered DNA repair protein involved in the repair of DSBs after radiation or chemical damage. However, the function of RadD in DNA repair remains unclear. Here, we determined the crystal structures of RadD/ATP\u03b3S and RadD/ATP complexes and revealed the novel mechanism of RadD binding to DNA and ATP hydrolysis with biochemical data. In the RadD catalytic center, the Gly34 and Gly36 on the P-loop are key residues for ATP binding besides the conserved amino acids Lys37 and Arg343 in the SF2 family. If any of them mutate, then RadD loses ATPase activity. Asp117 polarizes the attacking water molecule, which then starts a nucleophilic reaction toward \u03b3-phosphate, forming the transition state. Lys68 acts as a pocket switch to regulate substrate entry and product release. We revealed that the C-terminal peptide of single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) binds the RadD C-terminal domain (CTD) and promotes the RadD ATPase activity. Our mutagenesis studies confirmed that the residues Arg428 on the zinc finger domain (ZFD) and Lys488 on the CTD of RadD are the key sites for binding branched DNA. Using the Coot software combined with molecular docking, we propose a RadD-binding DNA model for the DNA damage repair process.",

    "abstract": "The flavoprotein methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) catalyzes the reduction of N5, N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate) to N5-methyltetrahydrofolate (CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate), committing a methyl group from the folate cycle to the methionine one. This committed step is the sum of multiple ping-pong electron transfers involving multiple substrates, intermediates, and products all sharing the same active site. Insight into folate substrate binding is needed to better understand this multifunctional active site. Here, we performed activity assays with Thermus thermophilus MTHFR (tMTHFR), which showed pH-dependent inhibition by the substrate analog, N5-formyltetrahydrofolate (CHO-H<sub>4</sub>folate). Our crystal structure of a tMTHFR\u2022CHO-H<sub>4</sub>folate complex revealed a unique folate-binding mode; tMTHFR subtly rearranges its active site to form a distinct folate-binding environment. Formation of a novel binding pocket for the CHO-H<sub>4</sub>folate p-aminobenzoic acid moiety directly affects how bent the folate ligand is and its accommodation in the active site. Comparative analysis of the available active (FAD- and folate-bound) MTHFR complex structures reveals that CHO-H<sub>4</sub>folate is accommodated in the active site in a conformation that would not support hydride transfer, but rather in a conformation that potentially reports on a different step in the reaction mechanism after this committed step, such as CH<sub>2</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>folate ring-opening. This active site remodeling provides insights into the functional relevance of the differential folate-binding modes and their potential roles in the catalytic cycle. The conformational flexibility displayed by tMTHFR demonstrates how a shared active site can use a few amino acid residues in lieu of extra domains to accommodate chemically distinct moieties and functionalities.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNA (miRNA) and RNA interference (RNAi) pathways rely on small RNAs produced by Dicer endonucleases. Mammalian Dicer primarily supports the essential gene-regulating miRNA pathway, but how it is specifically adapted to miRNA biogenesis is unknown. We show that the adaptation entails a unique structural role of Dicer's DExD/H helicase domain. Although mice tolerate loss of its putative ATPase function, the complete absence of the domain is lethal because it assures high-fidelity miRNA biogenesis. Structures of murine Dicer\u2022-miRNA precursor complexes revealed that the DExD/H domain has a helicase-unrelated structural function. It locks Dicer in a closed state, which facilitates miRNA precursor selection. Transition to a cleavage-competent open state is stimulated by Dicer-binding protein TARBP2. Absence of the DExD/H domain or its mutations unlocks the closed state, reduces substrate selectivity, and activates RNAi. Thus, the DExD/H domain structurally contributes to mammalian miRNA biogenesis and underlies mechanistical partitioning of miRNA and RNAi pathways.",

    "abstract": "Type I restriction-modification systems help establish the prokaryotic DNA methylation landscape and provide protection against invasive DNA. In addition to classical m6A modifications, non-canonical type I enzymes catalyze both m6A and m4C using alternative DNA-modification subunits M1 and M2. Here, we report the crystal structures of the non-canonical PacII_M1M2S methyltransferase bound to target DNA and reaction product S-adenosylhomocysteine in a closed clamp-like conformation. Target DNA binds tightly within the central tunnel of the M1M2S complex and forms extensive contacts with all three protein subunits. Unexpectedly, while the target cytosine properly inserts into M2's pocket, the target adenine (either unmethylated or methylated) is anchored outside M1's pocket. A unique asymmetric catalysis is established where PacII_M1M2S has precisely coordinated the relative conformations of different subunits and evolved specific amino acids within M2/M1. This work provides insights into mechanisms of m6A/m4C catalysis and guidance for designing tools based on type I restriction-modification enzymes.",

    "abstract": "RNA modifications are widespread in biology and abundant in ribosomal RNA. However, the importance of these modifications is not well understood. We show that methylation of a single nucleotide, in the catalytic center of the large subunit, gates ribosome assembly. Massively parallel mutational scanning of the essential nuclear GTPase Nog2 identified important interactions with rRNA, particularly with the 2'-O-methylated A-site base Gm2922. We found that methylation of G2922 is needed for assembly and efficient nuclear export of the large subunit. Critically, we identified single amino acid changes in Nog2 that completely bypass dependence on G2922 methylation and used cryoelectron microscopy to directly visualize how methylation flips Gm2922 into the active site channel of Nog2. This work demonstrates that a single RNA modification is a critical checkpoint in ribosome biogenesis, suggesting that such modifications can play an important role in regulation and assembly of macromolecular machines.",

    "abstract": "Malic enzymes (ME1, ME2, and ME3) are involved in cellular energy regulation, redox homeostasis, and biosynthetic processes, through the production of pyruvate and reducing agent NAD(P)H. Recent studies have implicated the third and least well-characterized isoform, mitochondrial NADP<sup>+</sup>-dependent malic enzyme 3 (ME3), as a therapeutic target for pancreatic cancers. Here, we utilized an integrated structure approach to determine the structures of ME3 in various ligand-binding states at near-atomic resolutions. ME3 is captured in the open form existing as a stable tetramer and its dynamic Domain C is critical for activity. Catalytic assay results reveal that ME3 is a non-allosteric enzyme and does not require modulators for activity while structural analysis suggests that the inner stability of ME3 Domain A relative to ME2 disables allostery in ME3. With structural information available for all three malic enzymes, the foundation has been laid to understand the structural and biochemical differences of these enzymes and could aid in the development of specific malic enzyme small molecule drugs.",

    "abstract": "Enzymatic cleavage of IgG antibodies is a common strategy used by pathogenic bacteria to ablate immune effector function. The Streptococcus pyogenes bacterium secretes the protease IdeS and the glycosidase EndoS, which specifically catalyse cleavage and deglycosylation of human IgG, respectively. IdeS has received clinical approval for kidney transplantation in hypersensitised individuals, while EndoS has found application in engineering antibody glycosylation. We present crystal structures of both enzymes in complex with their IgG1 Fc substrate, which was achieved using Fc engineering to disfavour preferential Fc crystallisation. The IdeS protease displays extensive Fc recognition and encases the antibody hinge. Conversely, the glycan hydrolase domain in EndoS traps the Fc glycan in a \"flipped-out\" conformation, while additional recognition of the Fc peptide is driven by the so-called carbohydrate binding module. In this work, we reveal the molecular basis of antibody recognition by bacterial enzymes, providing a template for the development of next-generation enzymes.",

Information-rich techniques such as crystallographic fragment screening can potentially increase the efficiency of this step by providing the structural information of the binding mode of the ligands in addition to the mere binding information. Here, we present the crystallographic screening of our 1000-plus-compound F2X-Universal Library against the complex of the yeast spliceosomal Prp8 RNaseH-like domain and the snRNP assembly factor Aar2. The observed 269 hits are distributed over 10 distinct binding sites on the surface of the protein-protein complex. Our work shows that hit clusters from large-scale crystallographic fragment screening campaigns identify known interaction sites with other proteins and suggest putative additional interaction sites. Furthermore, the inherent binding pose validation within the hit clusters may accelerate downstream compound optimization.",

Small molecule hormones and competitive antagonists favor unique ER\u03b1 conformational ensembles that elicit ligand-specific transcriptional programs in breast cancer and other hormone-responsive tissues. By affecting disparate ligand binding domain structural features, unconventional ligand scaffolds can redirect ER\u03b1 genomic binding patterns to engage novel therapeutic transcriptional programs. To improve our understanding of these ER\u03b1 structure-transcriptional relationships, we develop a series of chemically unconventional antagonists based on the antiestrogens elacestrant and lasofoxifene. High-resolution x-ray co-crystal structures show that these molecules affect both classical and unique structural motifs within the ER\u03b1 ligand binding pocket. They show moderately reduced antagonistic potencies on ER\u03b1 genomic activities but are effective anti-proliferative agents in luminal breast cancer cells. Interestingly, they favor a 4-hydroxytamoxifen-like accumulation of ER\u03b1 in breast cancer cells but lack uterotrophic activities in an endometrial cell line. Importantly, RNA sequencing shows that the lead molecules engage transcriptional pathways similar to the selective estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant. This advance shows that fulvestrant-like genomic activities can be achieved without affecting ER\u03b1 accumulation in breast cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "An essential step in bacterial transformation is the uptake of DNA into the periplasm, across the thick peptidoglycan cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, or the outer membrane and thin peptidoglycan layer of Gram-negative bacteria. ComEA, a DNA-binding protein widely conserved in transformable bacteria, is required for this uptake step. Here we determine X-ray crystal structures of ComEA from two Gram-positive species, Bacillus subtilis and Geobacillus stearothermophilus, identifying a domain that is absent in Gram-negative bacteria. X-ray crystallographic, genetic, and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) analyses reveal that this domain drives ComEA oligomerization, which we show is required for transformation. We use multi-wavelength AUC (MW-AUC) to characterize the interaction between DNA and the ComEA DNA-binding domain. Finally, we present a model for the interaction of the ComEA DNA-binding domain with DNA, suggesting that ComEA oligomerization may provide a pulling force that drives DNA uptake across the thick cell walls of Gram-positive bacteria.",

    "abstract": "The Ricin toxin A chain (RTA), which depurinates an adenine base at a specific region of the ribosome leading to death, has two adjacent specificity pockets in its active site. Based on this structural information, many attempts have been made to develop small-molecule RTA inhibitors that simultaneously block the two pockets. However, no attempt has been successful. In the present study, we synthesized pterin-7-carboxamides with tripeptide pendants and found that one of them interacts with both pockets simultaneously to exhibit good RTA inhibitory activity. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the RTA crystal with the new inhibitor revealed that the conformational change of Tyr80 is an important factor that allows the inhibitors to plug the two pockets simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "Ferulic acid is a common constituent of the plant cell-wall matrix where it decorates and can crosslink mainly arabinoxylans to provide structural reinforcement. Microbial feruloyl esterases (FAEs) specialize in catalyzing hydrolysis of the ester bonds between phenolic acids and sugar residues in plant cell-wall polysaccharides such as arabinoxylan to release cinnamoyl compounds. Feruloyl esterases from lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been highlighted as interesting enzymes for their potential applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries; however, there are few studies on the activity and structure of FAEs of LAB origin. Here, we report the crystal structure and biochemical characterization of a feruloyl esterase (<i>Lb</i>FAE) from <i>Lentilactobacillus buchneri</i>, a LAB strain that has been used as a silage additive. The <i>Lb</i>FAE structure was determined in the absence and presence of product (FA) and reveals a new type of homodimer association not previously observed for fungal or bacterial FAEs. The two subunits associate to restrict access to the active site such that only single FA chains attached to arabinoxylan can be accommodated, an arrangement that excludes access to FA cross-links between arabinoxylan chains. This narrow specificity is further corroborated by the observation that no FA dimers are produced, only FA, when feruloylated arabinoxylan is used as substrate. Docking of arabinofuranosyl-ferulate in the <i>Lb</i>FAE structure highlights the restricted active site and lends further support to our hypothesis that <i>Lb</i>FAE is specific for single FA side chains in arabinoxylan.",

    "abstract": "DEAD-box ATPases are ubiquitous enzymes essential in all aspects of RNA biology. However, the limited in vitro catalytic activities described for these enzymes are at odds with their complex cellular roles, most notably in driving large-scale RNA remodeling steps during the assembly of ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). We describe cryo-EM structures of 60S ribosomal biogenesis intermediates that reveal how context-specific RNA unwinding by the DEAD-box ATPase Spb4 results in extensive, sequence-specific remodeling of rRNA secondary structure. Multiple cis and trans interactions stabilize Spb4 in a post-catalytic, high-energy intermediate that drives the organization of the three-way junction at the base of rRNA domain IV. This mechanism explains how limited strand separation by DEAD-box ATPases is leveraged to provide non-equilibrium directionality and ensure efficient and accurate RNP assembly.",

How HLA-B*27 facilitates disease remains unknown, but one possible mechanism could involve presentation of pathogenic peptides to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Here we isolated orphan T cell receptors (TCRs) expressing a disease-associated public\u00a0\u03b2-chain variable region-complementary-determining region 3\u03b2 (BV9-CDR3\u03b2) motif<sup>2-4</sup> from blood and synovial fluid T cells from individuals with AS and from\u00a0the eye in individuals with\u00a0AAU. These TCRs showed consistent \u03b1-chain variable region (AV21) chain pairing and were clonally expanded in the joint and eye. We used HLA-B*27:05 yeast display peptide libraries to identify shared self-peptides and microbial peptides that activated the AS- and AAU-derived TCRs. Structural analysis revealed that TCR cross-reactivity for peptide-MHC was rooted in a shared binding motif present in both self-antigens and microbial antigens that engages the BV9-CDR3\u03b2 TCRs. These findings support the hypothesis that microbial antigens and self-antigens could play a pathogenic role in HLA-B*27-associated disease.",

    "abstract": "Fatty acid kinase is necessary for the incorporation of exogenous fatty acids into membrane phospholipids. Fatty acid kinase consists of two components: a kinase component, FakA, that phosphorylates a fatty acid bound to a fatty acid-binding component, FakB. However, the molecular details underlying the phosphotransfer reaction remain to be resolved. We determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of FakA bound to ADP from Thermus thermophilus HB8. The overall structure of this domain showed that the helical barrel fold is similar to the nucleotide-binding component of dihydroxyacetone kinase. The structure of the nucleotide-binding site revealed the roles of the conserved residues in recognition of ADP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, but the N-terminal domain of FakA lacked the ADP-capping loop found in the dihydroxyacetone kinase component. Based on the structural similarity to the two subunits of dihydroxyacetone kinase complex, we constructed a model of the complex of T. thermophilus FakB and the N-terminal domain of FakA. In this model, the invariant Arg residue of FakB occupied a position that was spatially similar to that of the catalytically important Arg residue of dihydroxyacetone kinase, which predicted a composite active site in the Fatty acid kinase complex.",

    "abstract": "The DNA tensegrity triangle is known to reliably self-assemble into a 3D rhombohedral crystalline lattice via sticky-end cohesion. Here, the library of accessible motifs is expanded through\u00a0covalent extensions of intertriangle regions and sticky-end-coordinated linkages of adjacent triangles with double helical segments\u00a0using both geometrically symmetric and asymmetric configurations. The molecular structures of 18\u00a0self-assembled architectures at resolutions of 3.32-9.32\u00a0\u00c5 are reported; the observed cell dimensions, cavity sizes, and cross-sectional areas agree with theoretical expectations. These data demonstrate that fine control over triclinic and rhombohedral crystal parameters and the customizability of more complex 3D DNA lattices are attainable via rational design. It is anticipated that augmented DNA architectures may be fine-tuned for the self-assembly of designer nanocages, guest-host complexes, and proscriptive 3D nanomaterials, as originally envisioned. Finally, designer asymmetric crystalline building blocks can be seen as a first step toward controlling and encoding information in three dimensions.",

    "abstract": "Protein synthesis is crucial for cell growth and survival yet one of the most energy-consuming cellular processes. How, then, do cells sustain protein synthesis under starvation conditions when energy is limited? To accelerate the translocation of mRNA-tRNAs through the ribosome, bacterial elongation factor G (EF-G) hydrolyzes energy-rich guanosine triphosphate (GTP) for every amino acid incorporated into a protein. Here, we identify an EF-G paralog-EF-G2-that supports translocation without hydrolyzing GTP in the gut commensal bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. EF-G2's singular ability to sustain protein synthesis, albeit at slow rates, is crucial for bacterial gut colonization. EF-G2 is ~10-fold more abundant than canonical EF-G1 in bacteria harvested from murine ceca and, unlike EF-G1, specifically accumulates during carbon starvation. Moreover, we uncover a 26-residue region unique to EF-G2 that is essential for protein synthesis, EF-G2 dissociation from the ribosome, and responsible for the absence of GTPase activity. Our findings reveal how cells curb energy consumption while maintaining protein synthesis to advance fitness in nutrient-fluctuating environments.",

    "abstract": "Proton-activated chloride (PAC) channel is a ubiquitously expressed pH-sensing ion channel, encoded by <i>PACC1</i> (<i>TMEM206</i>). PAC regulates endosomal acidification and macropinosome shrinkage by releasing chloride from the organelle lumens. It is also found at the cell surface, where it is activated under pathological conditions related to acidosis and contributes to acid-induced cell death. However, the pharmacology of the PAC channel is poorly understood. Here, we report that phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) potently inhibits PAC channel activity. We solved the cryo-electron microscopy structure of PAC with PIP<sub>2</sub> at pH 4.0 and identified its putative binding site, which, surprisingly, locates on the extracellular side of the transmembrane domain (TMD). While the overall conformation resembles the previously resolved PAC structure in the desensitized state, the TMD undergoes remodeling upon PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding. Structural and electrophysiological analyses suggest that PIP<sub>2</sub> inhibits the PAC channel by stabilizing the channel in a desensitized-like conformation. Our findings identify PIP<sub>2</sub> as a new pharmacological tool for the PAC channel and lay the foundation for future drug discovery targeting this channel.",

    "abstract": "Signal-Peptide Peptidase Like-3 (SPPL3) is an intramembrane cleaving aspartyl protease that causes secretion of extracellular domains from type-II transmembrane proteins. Numerous Golgi-localized glycosidases and glucosyltransferases have been identified as physiological SPPL3 substrates. By SPPL3 dependent processing, glycan-transferring enzymes are deactivated inside the cell, as their active site-containing domain is cleaved and secreted. Thus, SPPL3 impacts on glycan patterns of many cellular and secreted proteins and can regulate protein glycosylation. However, the characteristics that make a substrate a favourable candidate for SPPL3-dependent cleavage remain unknown. To gain insights into substrate requirements, we investigated the function of a GxxxG motif located in the transmembrane domain of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnTV), a well-known SPPL3 substrate. SPPL3-dependent secretion of the substrate's ectodomain was affected by mutations disrupting the GxxxG motif. Using deuterium/hydrogen exchange and NMR spectroscopy, we studied the effect of these mutations on the helix flexibility of the GnTV transmembrane domain and observed that increased flexibility facilitates SPPL3-dependent shedding and vice versa. This study provides first insights into the characteristics of SPPL3 substrates, combining molecular biology, biochemistry, and biophysical techniques and its results will provide the basis for better understanding the characteristics of SPPL3 substrates with implications for the substrates of other intramembrane proteases.",

    "abstract": "Emerging variants of concern (VOCs) are threatening to limit the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies and vaccines currently used in clinical practice; broadly neutralizing antibodies and strategies for their identification are therefore urgently required. Here we demonstrate that broadly neutralizing antibodies can be isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of convalescent patients using SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domains carrying epitope-specific mutations. This is exemplified by two human antibodies, GAR05, binding to epitope class 1, and GAR12, binding to a new epitope class 6 (located between class 3 and 5). Both antibodies broadly neutralize VOCs, exceeding the potency of the clinical monoclonal sotrovimab (S309) by orders of magnitude. They also provide prophylactic and therapeutic in vivo protection of female hACE2 mice against viral challenge. Our results indicate that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 induces antibodies that maintain broad neutralization against emerging VOCs using two unique strategies: either by targeting the divergent class 1 epitope in a manner resistant to VOCs (ACE2 mimicry, as illustrated by GAR05 and mAbs P2C-1F11/S2K14); or alternatively, by targeting rare and highly conserved epitopes, such as the new class 6 epitope identified here (as illustrated by GAR12). Our results provide guidance for next generation monoclonal antibody development and vaccine design.",

    "abstract": "Most experimental methods for structural biology proceed in vitro and therefore the contribution of the intracellular environment on protein structure and dynamics is absent. Studying proteins at atomic resolution in living mammalian cells has been elusive due to the lack of methodologies. In-cell nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (in-cell NMR) is an emerging technique with the power to do so. Here, we improved current methods of in-cell NMR by the development of a reporter system that allows monitoring the delivery of exogenous proteins into mammalian cells, a process that we called here \"transexpression\". The reporter system was used to develop an efficient protocol for in-cell NMR which enables spectral acquisition with higher quality for both disordered and folded proteins. With this method, the 3D atomic resolution structure of the model protein GB1 in human cells was determined with a backbone root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 1.1\u2009\u00c5.",

    "abstract": "The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that controls metabolic and homeostatic processes essential for life. Although numerous crystal structures of the GR ligand-binding domain (GR-LBD) have been reported, the functional oligomeric state of the full-length receptor, which is essential for its transcriptional activity, remains disputed. Here we present five new crystal structures of agonist-bound GR-LBD, along with a thorough analysis of previous structural work. We identify four distinct homodimerization interfaces on the GR-LBD surface, which can associate into 20 topologically different homodimers. Biologically relevant homodimers were identified by studying a battery of GR point mutants including crosslinking assays in solution, quantitative fluorescence microscopy in living cells, and transcriptomic analyses. Our results highlight the relevance of non-canonical dimerization modes for GR, especially of contacts made by loop L1-3 residues such as Tyr545. Our work illustrates the unique flexibility of GR's LBD and suggests different dimeric conformations within cells. In addition, we unveil pathophysiologically relevant quaternary assemblies of the receptor with important implications for glucocorticoid action and drug design.",

    "abstract": "Chemotherapy of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) has significantly developed over the last three decades. The emergence of drug-resistant variants is, however, still a severe problem. The RNase H activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase is an attractive target for a new class of antiviral drugs because there is no approved inhibitor. The nitro-furan-carbonyl and nitro-thiophene-carbonyl groups are potent scaffolds for the HIV-1 RNase H inhibitor. In this work, the binding structures of six inhibitory compounds were obtained by X-ray crystal analysis in a complex with a recombinant protein of HIV-1 RNase H domain. Every inhibitory compound was found to be bound to the catalytic site with the furan- or thiophene-ring coordinated to two divalent metal ions at the binding pocket. All the atoms in nitro, furan, carbonyl, and two metals were aligned in the nitro-furan derivatives. The straight line connecting nitro and carboxyl groups was parallel to the plane made by two metal ions and a furan O atom. The binding modes of the nitro-thiophene derivatives were slightly different from those of the nitro-furan ones. The nitro and carbonyl groups deviated from the plane made by two metals and a thiophene S atom. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the furan O or thiophene S atom and carbonyl O atom were firmly coordinated to the metal ions. The simulations made the planar nitro-furan moiety well aligned to the line connecting the two metal ions. In contrast, the nitro-thiophene derivatives were displaced from the initial positions after the simulations. The computational findings will be a sound basis for developing potent inhibitors for HIV-1 RNase H activity.",

    "abstract": "The nonstructural protein 3 (NSP3) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) contains a conserved macrodomain enzyme (Mac1) that is critical for pathogenesis and lethality. While small-molecule inhibitors of Mac1 have great therapeutic potential, at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were no well-validated inhibitors for this protein nor, indeed, the macrodomain enzyme family, making this target a pharmacological orphan. Here, we report the structure-based discovery and development of several different chemical scaffolds exhibiting low- to sub-micromolar affinity for Mac1 through iterations of computer-aided design, structural characterization by ultra-high-resolution protein crystallography, and binding evaluation. Potent scaffolds were designed with in silico fragment linkage and by ultra-large library docking of over 450 million molecules. Both techniques leverage the computational exploration of tangible chemical space and are applicable to other pharmacological orphans. Overall, 160 ligands in 119 different scaffolds were discovered, and 153 Mac1-ligand complex crystal structures were determined, typically to 1 \u00c5 resolution or better. Our analyses discovered selective and cell-permeable molecules, unexpected ligand-mediated conformational changes within the active site, and key inhibitor motifs that will template future drug development against Mac1.",

We show that v-cADPR (2'cADPR) and v2-cADPR (3'cADPR) isomers are cyclized by O-glycosidic bond formation between the ribose moieties in ADPR. Structures of 2'cADPR-producing TIR domains reveal conformational changes that lead to an active assembly that resembles those of Toll-like receptor adaptor TIR domains. Mutagenesis reveals a conserved tryptophan that is essential for cyclization. We show that 3'cADPR is an activator of ThsA effector proteins from the bacterial antiphage defense system termed Thoeris and a suppressor of plant immunity when produced by the effector HopAM1.

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial complex I is a redox-driven proton pump that generates proton-motive force across the inner mitochondrial membrane, powering oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis in eukaryotes. We report the structure of complex I from the thermophilic fungus <i>Chaetomium thermophilum</i>, determined by cryoEM up to 2.4-\u00c5 resolution. We show that the complex undergoes a transition between two conformations, which we refer to as state 1 and state 2. The conformational switch is manifest in a twisting movement of the peripheral arm relative to the membrane arm, but most notably in substantial rearrangements of the Q-binding cavity and the E-channel, resulting in a continuous aqueous passage from the E-channel to subunit ND5 at the far end of the membrane arm. The conformational changes in the complex interior resemble those reported for mammalian complex I, suggesting a highly conserved, universal mechanism of coupling electron transport to proton pumping.",

In this study, we combine cryo-electron microscopy methods, protein structure prediction methods, molecular simulations, microbiological and machine learning approaches to explore the capsid, tail, and tail fibers of \u03d5Kp24. We determine the structure of the capsid and tail at 4.1\u2009\u00c5 and 3.0\u2009\u00c5 resolution. We observe the tail fibers are branched and rearranged dramatically upon cell surface attachment. This complex configuration involves fourteen putative tail fibers with depolymerase activity that provide \u03d5Kp24 with the ability to infect a broad panel of capsular polysaccharide (CPS) types of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Our study provides structural and functional insight into how \u03d5Kp24 adapts to the variable surfaces of capsulated bacterial pathogens, which is useful for the development of phage therapy approaches against pan-drug resistant K. pneumoniae strains.",

    "abstract": "The folding of newly synthesized polypeptides requires the coordinated action of molecular chaperones. Prokaryotic cells and the chloroplasts of plant cells possess the ribosome-associated chaperone trigger factor, which binds nascent polypeptides at their exit stage from the ribosomal tunnel. The structure of bacterial trigger factor has been well characterized and it has a dragon-shaped conformation, with flexible domains responsible for ribosome binding, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization (PPIase) activity and substrate protein binding. Chloroplast trigger-factor sequences have diversified from those of their bacterial orthologs and their molecular mechanism in plant organelles has been little investigated to date. Here, the crystal structure of the plastidic trigger factor from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is presented at 2.6\u2005\u00c5 resolution. Due to the high intramolecular flexibility of the protein, diffraction to this resolution was only achieved using a protein that lacked the N-terminal ribosome-binding domain. The eukaryotic trigger factor from C. reinhardtii exhibits a comparable dragon-shaped conformation to its bacterial counterpart. However, the C-terminal chaperone domain displays distinct charge distributions, with altered positioning of the helical arms and a specifically altered charge distribution along the surface responsible for substrate binding. While the PPIase domain shows a highly conserved structure compared with other PPIases, its rather weak activity and an unusual orientation towards the C-terminal domain points to specific adaptations of eukaryotic trigger factor for function in chloroplasts.",

In this study, we determined the crystal structure of YbeY from <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> at a resolution of 1.9 \u00c5 in the presence of zinc chloride. The structure showed a zinc ion at the active site and two molecules of tricarboxylic acid citrate, which were also derived from the crystallization conditions. Our structure showed the zinc ion-bound local environment at the molecular level for the first time. Molecular comparisons were performed between the carboxylic moieties of citrate and the phosphate moiety of the RNA backbone, and a model of YbeY in complex with a single strand of RNA was subsequently constructed. Our findings provide molecular insights into how the YbeY enzyme recognizes single-stranded RNA in bacteria.",

A majority of GPCRs promiscuously couple to multiple G protein subtypes. Here we validate that in addition to the well-known G<sub>i/o</sub> pathway, somatostatin receptor 2 and 5 (SSTR2 and SSTR5) couple to the G<sub>q/11</sub> pathway and show that smaller ligands preferentially activate the G<sub>i/o</sub> pathway. We further determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of the SSTR2\u2012G<sub>o</sub> and SSTR2\u2012G<sub>q</sub> complexes bound to octreotide and SST-14. Structural and functional analysis revealed that G protein selectivity of SSTRs is not only determined by structural elements in the receptor-G protein interface, but also by the conformation of the agonist-binding pocket. Accordingly, smaller ligands fail to stabilize a broader agonist-binding pocket of SSTRs that is required for efficient G<sub>q/11</sub> coupling but not G<sub>i/o</sub> coupling. Our studies facilitate the design of drugs with selective G protein signaling to improve therapeutic efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria are photosynthesizing prokaryotes responsible for the Great Oxygenation Event on Earth ~2.5\u00a0Ga\u00a0years ago. They use a specific photoprotective mechanism based on the 35-kDa photoactive Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP), a promising target for developing novel optogenetic tools and for biomass engineering. The two-domain OCP presumably stems from domain fusion, yet the primitive thylakoid-less cyanobacteria Gloeobacter encodes a complete OCP. Its photosynthesis regulation lacks the so-called Fluorescence Recovery Protein (FRP), which in Synechocystis inhibits OCP-mediated phycobilisome fluorescence quenching, and Gloeobacter OCP belongs to the recently defined, heterogeneous clade OCPX (GlOCPX), the least characterized compared to OCP2 and especially OCP1 clades. Here, we describe the first crystal structure of OCPX, which explains unique functional adaptations of Gloeobacter OCPX compared to OCP1 from Synechocystis. We show that monomeric GlOCPX exploits a remarkable intramolecular locking mechanism stabilizing its dark-adapted state and exhibits drastically accelerated, less temperature-dependent recovery after photoactivation. While GlOCPX quenches Synechocystis phycobilisomes similar to Synechocystis OCP1, it evades interaction with and regulation by FRP from other species and likely uses alternative mechanisms for fluorescence recovery. This analysis of a primordial OCPX sheds light on its evolution, rationalizing renaming and subdivision of the OCPX clade into subclades - OCP3a, OCP3b, OCP3c.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium species cause malaria and kill hundreds of thousands annually. The microtubule-based motor kinesin-8B is required for development of the flagellated Plasmodium male gamete, and its absence completely blocks parasite transmission. To understand the molecular basis of kinesin-8B's essential role, we characterised the in vitro properties of kinesin-8B motor domains from P. berghei and P. falciparum. Both motors drive ATP-dependent microtubule gliding, but also catalyse ATP-dependent microtubule depolymerisation. We determined these motors' microtubule-bound structures using cryo-electron microscopy, which showed very similar modes of microtubule interaction in which Plasmodium-distinct sequences at the microtubule-kinesin interface influence motor function. Intriguingly however, P. berghei kinesin-8B exhibits a non-canonical structural response to ATP analogue binding such that neck linker docking is not induced. Nevertheless, the neck linker region is required for motility and depolymerisation activities of these motors. These data suggest that the mechanochemistry of Plasmodium kinesin-8Bs is functionally tuned to support flagella formation.",

    "abstract": "Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria lead to considerable morbidity and mortality, threatening public health worldwide. In particular, infections of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in hospital and community settings are becoming a serious health problem. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered novel therapeutic targets against MDR bacteria. However, salt sensitivity reduces the bactericidal potency of AMPs, posing a major obstacle for their development as antibiotics. Thus, the design and development of salt-insensitive peptides with potent antibacterial activity is imperative. Here, we employed biochemical and biophysical examinations coupled with molecular modeling to systematically investigate the structure-function relationship of a novel salt-insensitive AMP, RR14. The secondary structure of RR14 was characterized as an apparent \u03b1-helix, a structure that confers strong membrane-permeabilizing ability targeting bacterial-mimetic membranes. Additionally, the bioactive structure of RR14 was determined in complex with dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles, where it possesses a central \u03b1-helical segment comprising residues R4 to K13 (R4-K13). RR14 was observed to orient itself into the DPC micelle with its N terminus and the \u03b1-helical segment (I5-R10) buried inside the micelles, which is essential for membrane permeabilization and bactericidal activity. Moreover, the specific and featured arrangement of positively charged residues of RR14 on its amphipathic helical conformation has great potential to render its strong salt resistance ability. Our study explored the structure-function relationship of RR14, explaining its possible mode of action against MRSA and other microbes. The insights obtained are of great applicability for the development of new antibacterial agents. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Many antimicrobial peptides have been observed to become inactive in the presence of high salt concentrations. To further develop new and novel AMPs with potent bactericidal activity and salt insensitivity, understanding the structural basis for salt resistance is important. Here, we employed biochemical and biophysical examinations to systematically investigate the structure-function relationship of a novel salt-insensitive AMP, RR14. RR14 was observed to orient itself into DPC micelles with the N terminus and the \u03b1-helical segment (I5-R10) buried inside the micelles, which is essential for membrane permeabilization and bactericidal activity. Moreover, the specific and featured arrangement of cationic residues of RR14 on its amphipathic helical conformation renders its strong salt resistance ability.

    "abstract": "The development of ligands for biological targets is critically dependent on the identification of sites on proteins that bind molecules with high affinity. A set of compounds, called FragLites, can identify such sites, along with the interactions required to gain affinity, by X-ray crystallography. We demonstrate the utility of FragLites in mapping the binding sites of bromodomain proteins BRD4 and ATAD2 and demonstrate that FragLite mapping is comparable to a full fragment screen in identifying ligand binding sites and key interactions. We extend the FragLite set with analogous compounds derived from amino acids (termed PepLites) that mimic the interactions of peptides. The output of the FragLite maps is shown to enable the development of ligands with leadlike potency. This work establishes the use of FragLite and PepLite screening at an early stage in ligand discovery allowing the rapid assessment of tractability of protein targets and informing downstream hit-finding.",

    "abstract": "Complex I is the first enzyme in the respiratory chain, which is responsible for energy production in mitochondria and bacteria<sup>1</sup>. Complex I couples the transfer of two electrons from NADH to quinone and the translocation of four protons across the membrane<sup>2</sup>, but the coupling mechanism remains contentious. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of Escherichia coli complex I (EcCI) in different redox states, including catalytic turnover. EcCI exists mostly in the open state, in which the quinone cavity is exposed to the cytosol, allowing access for water molecules, which enable quinone movements. Unlike the mammalian paralogues<sup>3</sup>, EcCI can convert to the closed state only during turnover, showing that closed and open states are genuine turnover intermediates. The open-to-closed transition results in the tightly engulfed quinone cavity being connected to the central axis of the membrane arm, a source of substrate protons. Consistently, the proportion of the closed state increases with increasing pH. We propose a detailed but straightforward and robust mechanism comprising a 'domino effect' series of proton transfers and electrostatic interactions: the forward wave ('dominoes stacking') primes the pump, and the reverse wave ('dominoes falling') results in the ejection of all pumped protons from the distal subunit NuoL. This mechanism explains why protons exit exclusively from the NuoL subunit and is supported by our mutagenesis data. We contend that this is a universal coupling mechanism of complex I and related enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Lysosomes are essential for cellular recycling, nutrient signaling, autophagy, and pathogenic bacteria and viruses invasion. Lysosomal fusion is fundamental to cell survival and requires HOPS, a conserved heterohexameric tethering complex. On the membranes to be fused, HOPS binds small membrane-associated GTPases and assembles SNAREs for fusion, but how the complex fulfills its function remained speculative. Here, we used cryo-electron microscopy to reveal the structure of HOPS. Unlike previously reported, significant flexibility of HOPS is confined to its extremities, where GTPase binding occurs. The SNARE-binding module is firmly attached to the core, therefore, ideally positioned between the membranes to catalyze fusion. Our data suggest a model for how HOPS fulfills its dual functionality of tethering and fusion and indicate why it is an essential part of the membrane fusion machinery.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of enzyme activity is vital for living organisms. In metalloenzymes, far-reaching rearrangements of the protein scaffold are generally required to tune the metal cofactor's properties by allosteric regulation. Here structural analysis of hydroxyketoacid aldolase from Sphingomonas wittichii RW1 (SwHKA) revealed a dynamic movement of the metal cofactor between two coordination spheres without protein scaffold rearrangements. In its resting state configuration (M<sup>2+</sup> <sub>R</sub> ), the metal constitutes an integral part of the dimer interface within the overall hexameric assembly, but sterical constraints do not allow for substrate binding. Conversely, a second coordination sphere constitutes the catalytically active state (M<sup>2+</sup> <sub>A</sub> ) at 2.4\u2005\u00c5 distance. Bidentate coordination of a ketoacid substrate to M<sup>2+</sup> <sub>A</sub> affords the overall lowest energy complex, which drives the transition from M<sup>2+</sup> <sub>R</sub> to M<sup>2+</sup> <sub>A</sub> . While not described earlier, this type of regulation may be widespread and largely overlooked due to low occupancy of some of its states in protein crystal structures.",

    "abstract": "TMEM16F, a member of the conserved TMEM16 family, plays a central role in the initiation of blood coagulation and the fusion of trophoblasts. The protein mediates passive ion and lipid transport in response to an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However, the mechanism of how the protein facilitates both processes has remained elusive. Here we investigate the basis for TMEM16F activation. In a screen of residues lining the proposed site of conduction, we identify mutants with strongly activating phenotype. Structures of these mutants determined herein by cryo-electron microscopy show major rearrangements leading to the exposure of hydrophilic patches to the membrane, whose distortion facilitates lipid diffusion. The concomitant opening of a pore promotes ion conduction in the same protein conformation. Our work has revealed a mechanism that is distinct for this branch of the family and that will aid the development of a specific pharmacology for a promising drug target.",

    "abstract": "The key enzymes involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway have been extensively studied in seed plants, but relatively less in ferns. In this study, two 4-Coumarate: coenzyme A ligases (Sc4CL1 and Sc4CL2) and one novel chalcone synthase (ScCHS1) were functionally characterized by mining the Stenoloma chusanum transcriptome database. Recombinant Sc4CLs were able to esterify various hydroxycinnamic acids to corresponding acyl-coenzyme A (CoA). ScCHS1 could catalyze p-coumaroyl-CoA, cinnamoyl-CoA, caffeoyl-CoA, and feruloyl-CoA to form naringenin, pinocembrin, eriodictyol, and homoeriodictyol, respectively. Moreover, enzymatic kinetics studies revealed that the optimal substrates of ScCHS1 were feruloyl-CoA and caffeoyl-CoA, rather than p-coumaroyl-CoA, which was substantially different from the common CHSs. Crystallographic and site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicated that the amino acid residues, Leu87, Leu97, Met165, and Ile200, located in the substrate-binding pocket near the B-ring of products, could exert a significant impact on the unique catalytic activity of ScCHS1. Furthermore, overexpression of ScCHS1 in tt4 mutants could partially rescue the mutant phenotypes. Finally, ScCHS1 and Sc4CL1 were used to synthesize flavanones and flavones with multi-substituted hydroxyl and methoxyl B-ring in Escherichia coli, which can effectively eliminate the need for the cytochrome P450 hydroxylation/O-methyltransferase from simple phenylpropanoid acids. In summary, the identification of these important Stenoloma enzymes provides a springboard for the future production of various flavonoids in E. coli.",

    "abstract": "Three psbA genes (psbA<sub>1</sub>, psbA<sub>2</sub>, and psbA<sub>3</sub>) encoding the D1 subunit of photosystem II (PSII) are present in the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus and are expressed differently in response to changes in the growth environment. To clarify the functional differences of the D1 protein expressed from these psbA genes, PSII dimers from two strains, each expressing only one psbA gene (psbA<sub>2</sub> or psbA<sub>3</sub>), were crystallized, and we analyzed their structures at resolutions comparable to previously studied PsbA1-PSII. Our results showed that the hydrogen bond between pheophytin/D1 (Pheo<sub>D1</sub>) and D1-130 became stronger in PsbA2- and PsbA3-PSII due to change of Gln to Glu, which partially explains the increase in the redox potential of Pheo<sub>D1</sub> observed in PsbA3. In PsbA2, one hydrogen bond was lost in Pheo<sub>D1</sub> due to the change of D1-Y147F, which may explain the decrease in stability of Pheo<sub>D1</sub> in PsbA2. Two water molecules in the Cl-1 channel were lost in PsbA2 due to the change of D1-P173M, leading to the narrowing of the channel, which may explain the lower efficiency of the S-state transition beyond S<sub>2</sub> in PsbA2-PSII. In PsbA3-PSII, a hydrogen bond between D1-Ser270 and a sulfoquinovosyl-diacylglycerol molecule near Q<sub>B</sub> disappeared due to the change of D1-Ser270 in PsbA1 and PsbA2 to D1-Ala270. This may result in an easier exchange of bound Q<sub>B</sub> with free plastoquinone, hence an enhancement of oxygen evolution in PsbA3-PSII due to its high Q<sub>B</sub> exchange efficiency. These results provide a structural basis for further functional examination of the three PsbA variants.",

Here, we elucidate the enigmatic structural transitions of assembly intermediates from human and yeast cells during the nucleoplasmic maturation phase. After dissociation of all 90S factors, the 40S body adopts a close-to-mature conformation, whereas the 3' major domain, later forming the 40S head, remains entirely immature. A first coordination is facilitated by the assembly factors TSR1 and BUD23-TRMT112, followed by re-positioning of RRP12 that is already recruited early to the 90S for further head rearrangements. Eventually, the uS2 cluster, CK1 (Hrr25 in yeast) and the export factor SLX9 associate with the pre-40S to provide export competence. These exemplary findings reveal the evolutionary conserved mechanism of how yeast and humans assemble the 40S ribosomal subunit, but reveal also a few minor differences.",

We performed a detailed analysis of the structure and compared it with ALDH1A1 structures from two other species, highlighting the significance of the differences. Structural superimposition reveals that the tetrameric molecule is asymmetrical, and the NAD<sup>+</sup>-binding domain exhibits a certain rotation. In addition, the noticeable structural differences were detected, including the unique contact between Ser461 and Asp148, as well as the side chain orientations of three amino acids residues, Asn474, Met471 and Phe466.

    "abstract": "Arrestins interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to stop G protein activation and to initiate key signaling pathways. Recent structural studies shed light on the molecular mechanisms involved in GPCR-arrestin coupling, but whether this process is conserved among GPCRs is poorly understood. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy active structure of the wild-type arginine-vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) in complex with \u03b2-arrestin1. It reveals an atypical position of \u03b2-arrestin1 compared to previously described GPCR-arrestin assemblies, associated with an original V2R/\u03b2-arrestin1 interface involving all receptor intracellular loops. Phosphorylated sites of the V2R carboxyl terminus are clearly identified and interact extensively with the \u03b2-arrestin1 N-lobe, in agreement with structural data obtained with chimeric or synthetic systems. Overall, these findings highlight a notable structural variability among GPCR-arrestin signaling complexes.",

    "abstract": "Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a major cause of acute respiratory infections in infants and older adults, for which no vaccines or therapeutics are available. The viral fusion (F)\u00a0glycoprotein is required for entry and is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies; however, little is known about the humoral immune response generated from natural infection. Here, using prefusion-stabilized F proteins to interrogate memory B cells from two older adults, we obtain over 700 paired non-IgM antibody sequences representing 563 clonotypes, indicative of a highly polyclonal response. Characterization of 136 monoclonal antibodies reveals broad recognition of the protein surface, with potently neutralizing antibodies targeting each antigenic site. Cryo-EM studies further reveal two non-canonical sites and the molecular basis for recognition of the apex of hMPV F by two prefusion-specific neutralizing antibodies. Collectively, these results provide insight into the humoral response to hMPV infection in older adults and will help guide vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "With the ever-increasing number of synthesis-on-demand compounds for drug lead discovery, there is a great need for efficient search technologies. We present the successful application of a virtual screening method that combines two advances: (1) it avoids full library enumeration (2) products are evaluated by molecular docking, leveraging protein structural information. Crucially, these advances enable a structure-based technique that can efficiently explore libraries with billions of molecules and beyond. We apply this method to identify inhibitors of ROCK1 from almost one billion commercially available compounds. Out of 69 purchased compounds, 27 (39%) have K<sub>i</sub> values <\u200910\u2009\u00b5M. X-ray structures of two leads confirm their docked poses. This approach to docking scales roughly with the number of reagents that span a chemical space and is therefore multiple orders of magnitude faster than traditional docking.",

NMDARs are glycine- and glutamate-gated ion channels that exist as heterotetramers composed of obligatory GluN1 and GluN2(A-D) and/or GluN3(A-B). The GluN2C and GluN2D subunits form ion channels with distinct properties and spatio-temporal expression patterns. Here, we provide the structures of the agonist-bound human GluN1-2C NMDAR in the presence and absence of the GluN2C-selective positive allosteric potentiator (PAM), PYD-106, the agonist-bound GluN1-2A-2C tri-heteromeric NMDAR, and agonist-bound GluN1-2D NMDARs by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy. Our analysis shows unique inter-subunit\u00a0and domain arrangements of the GluN2C NMDARs, which contribute to functional regulation and formation of the PAM binding pocket and is distinct from GluN2D NMDARs. Our findings here provide the fundamental blueprint to study GluN2C- and GluN2D-containing NMDARs, which are uniquely involved in neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "The adaptor protein (AP) complexes not only form the inner layer of clathrin coats but also have clathrin-independent roles in membrane traffic whose mechanisms are unknown. HIV-1 Nef hijacks AP-1 to sequester major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I), evading immune detection. We found that AP-1:Arf1:Nef:MHC-I forms a coat on tubulated membranes without clathrin and determined its structure. The coat assembles via Arf1 dimer interfaces. AP-1-positive tubules are enriched in cells upon clathrin knockdown. Nef localizes preferentially to AP-1 tubules in cells, explaining how Nef sequesters MHC-I. Coat contact residues are conserved across Arf isoforms and the Arf-dependent AP complexes AP-1, AP-3, and AP-4. Thus, AP complexes can self-assemble with Arf1 into tubular coats without clathrin or other scaffolding factors. The AP-1:Arf1 coat defines the structural basis of a broader class of tubulovesicular membrane coats as an intermediate in clathrin vesicle formation from internal membranes and as an MHC-I sequestration mechanism in HIV-1 infection.",

RIG-I specifically recognizes the unique molecular features of viral RNA molecules and selectively distinguishes them from closely related RNAs abundant in host cells. The physical basis for this exquisite selectivity is revealed through a series of high-resolution cryo-EM structures of RIG-I in complex with host and viral RNA ligands. These studies demonstrate that RIG-I actively samples double-stranded RNAs in the cytoplasm and distinguishes them by adopting two different types of protein folds. Upon binding viral RNA, RIG-I adopts a high-affinity conformation that is conducive to signaling, while host RNA induces an autoinhibited conformation that stimulates RNA release. By coupling protein folding with RNA binding selectivity, RIG-I distinguishes RNA molecules that differ by as little as one phosphate group, thereby explaining the molecular basis for selective antiviral sensing and the induction of autoimmunity upon RIG-I dysregulation.",

We herein investigated the biosynthesis of vazabitide A, the structure of which is similar to that of azinomycin B, and demonstrated that Vzb10/11, with no similarities to known enzymes, catalyzed the formation of the aziridine ring via sulfate elimination. To elucidate the detailed reaction mechanism, crystallization of Vzb10/11 and the homologous enzyme, AziU3/U2, in the biosynthesis of azinomycin B was attempted, and the structure of AziU3/U2, which had a new protein fold overall, was successfully determined. The structural analysis revealed that these enzymes adjusted the dihedral angle between the amino group and the adjacent sulfate group of the substrate to almost 180\u00b0 and enhanced the nucleophilicity of the C6-amino group temporarily, facilitating the S<sub>N</sub>2-like reaction to form the aziridine ring. The present study reports for the first time the molecular basis for aziridine ring formation.",

Reaction sites are at long distance, and there are several co-factors that play as allosteric regulators. Here, using cryoEM we explore the structure of active PC tetramers focusing on active sites and on the conformational space of the oligomers. The results capture the mobile domain at both active sites and expose catalytic steps of both reactions at high resolution, allowing the identification of substrates and products. The analysis of catalytically active PC tetramers reveals the role of certain motions during enzyme functioning, and the structural changes in the presence of additional cofactors expose the mechanism for allosteric regulation.",

    "abstract": "Organophosphorus (OP) compounds, including nerve agents and some pesticides, covalently bind to the catalytic serine of human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE), thereby inhibiting acetylcholine hydrolysis necessary for efficient neurotransmission. Oxime antidotes can reactivate the OP-conjugated hAChE, but reactivation efficiency can be low for pesticides, such as paraoxon (POX). Understanding structural and dynamic determinants of OP inhibition and reactivation can provide insights to design improved reactivators. Here, X-ray structures of hAChE with unaged POX, with POX and oximes MMB4 and RS170B, and with MMB4 are reported. A significant conformational distortion of the acyl loop was observed upon POX binding, being partially restored to the native conformation by oximes. Neutron vibrational spectroscopy combined with molecular dynamics simulations showed that picosecond vibrational dynamics of the acyl loop soften in the \u223c20-50\u00a0cm<sup>-1</sup> frequency range. The acyl loop structural perturbations may be correlated with its picosecond vibrational dynamics to yield more comprehensive template for structure-based reactivator design.",

    "abstract": "The major cytoskeleton protein actin undergoes cyclic transitions between the monomeric G-form and the filamentous F-form, which drive organelle transport and cell motility. This mechanical work is driven by the ATPase activity at the catalytic site in the F-form. For deeper understanding of the actin cellular functions, the reaction mechanism must be elucidated. Here, we show that a single actin molecule is trapped in the F-form by fragmin domain-1 binding and present their crystal structures in the ATP analog-, ADP-Pi-, and ADP-bound forms, at 1.15-\u00c5 resolutions. The G-to-F conformational transition shifts the side chains of Gln137 and His161, which relocate four water molecules including W1 (attacking water) and W2 (helping water) to facilitate the hydrolysis. By applying quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations to the structures, we have revealed a consistent and comprehensive reaction path of ATP hydrolysis by the F-form actin. The reaction path consists of four steps: 1) W1 and W2 rotations; 2) P<sup>G</sup>-O<sup>3B</sup> bond cleavage; 3) four concomitant events: W1-PO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> formation, OH<sup>-</sup> and proton cleavage, nucleophilic attack by the OH<sup>-</sup> against P<sup>G</sup>, and the abstracted proton transfer; and 4) proton relocation that stabilizes the ADP-Pi-bound F-form actin. The mechanism explains the slow rate of ATP hydrolysis by actin and the irreversibility of the hydrolysis reaction. While the catalytic strategy of actin ATP hydrolysis is essentially the same as those of motor proteins like myosin, the process after the hydrolysis is distinct and discussed in terms of Pi release, F-form destabilization, and global conformational changes.",

For an active ML<sub><i>n</i></sub> complex, where L is the organic carrier, various binding modes (covalent and non-covalent, single or multiple) may occur and several metal moieties (M, ML, ML<sub>2</sub>, etc.) may interact with proteins. In this study, we have evaluated the interaction of [V<sup>IV</sup>O(malt)<sub>2</sub>] (bis(maltolato)oxidovanadium(IV) or BMOV, where malt = maltolato, i.e., the common name for 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4<i>H</i>-pyran-4-onato) with the model protein hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, electron paramagnetic resonance, and X-ray crystallography. The multiple binding of different V-containing isomers and enantiomers to different sites of HEWL is observed. The data indicate both non-covalent binding of <i>cis</i>-[VO(malt)<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)] and [VO(malt)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>+</sup> and covalent binding of [VO(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3-4</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> and <i>cis</i>-[VO(malt)<sub>2</sub>] and other V-containing fragments to the side chains of Glu35, Asp48, Asn65, Asp87, and Asp119 and to the C-terminal carboxylate.

However, the underlying mechanisms for enhanced infectivity, especially compared with BA.5, remain unclear. Here, we show that BA.2.75 exhibits substantially higher affinity for host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) than BA.5 and other variants. Structural analyses of BA.2.75 spike shows its decreased thermostability and increased frequency of the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the \"up\" conformation under acidic conditions, suggesting enhanced low-pH-endosomal cell entry. Relative to BA.4/BA.5, BA.2.75 exhibits reduced evasion of humoral immunity from BA.1/BA.2 breakthrough-infection convalescent plasma but greater evasion of Delta breakthrough-infection convalescent plasma. BA.5 breakthrough-infection plasma also exhibits weaker neutralization against BA.2.75 than BA.5, mainly due to BA.2.75's distinct neutralizing antibody (NAb) escape pattern. Antibody therapeutics Evusheld and Bebtelovimab remain effective against BA.2.75. These results suggest BA.2.75 may prevail after BA.4/BA.5, and its increased receptor-binding capability could support further immune-evasive mutations.",

    "abstract": "Cas7-11 is a Type III-E CRISPR Cas effector that confers programmable RNA cleavage and has potential applications in RNA interference. Cas7-11 encodes a single polypeptide containing four Cas7- and one Cas11-like segments that obscures the distinction between the multi-subunit Class 1 and the single-subunit Class-2 CRISPR Cas systems. We report a cryo-EM (cryo-electron microscopy) structure of the active Cas7-11 from <i>Desulfonema ishimotonii</i> (DiCas7-11) that reveals the molecular basis for RNA processing and interference activities. DiCas7-11 arranges its Cas7- and Cas11-like domains in an extended form that resembles the backbone made up by four Cas7 and one Cas11 subunits in the multi-subunit enzymes. Unlike the multi-subunit enzymes, however, the backbone of DiCas7-11 contains evolutionarily different Cas7 and Cas11 domains, giving rise to their unique functionality. The first Cas7-like domain nearly engulfs the last 15 direct repeat nucleotides in processing and recognition of the CRISPR RNA, and its free-standing fragment retains most of the activity. Both the second and the third Cas7-like domains mediate target RNA cleavage in a metal-dependent manner. The structure and mutational data indicate that the long variable insertion to the fourth Cas7 domain has little impact on RNA processing or targeting, suggesting the possibility for engineering a compact and programmable RNA interference tool.",

This report describes the first X-ray crystallographic structure models of apo and xylobiose-bound forms of a xylobiohydrolase (XBH) from Acetivibrio clariflavus. This xylan-active enzyme, a member of the recently described glycoside hydrolase family 30 (GH30), subfamily 10, phylogenetic clade has been shown to strictly release xylobiose as its primary hydrolysis product. Inspection of the apo structure reveals a glycone region X<sub>2</sub> -binding slot. When X<sub>2</sub> binds, the non-reducing xylose in the -2 subsite is highly coordinated with numerous hydrogen bond contacts while contacts in the -1 subsite mostly reflect interactions typical for GH30 and enzymes in clan A of the carbohydrate-active enzymes database (CAZy). This structure provides an explanation for the high functional specificity of this new bacterial GH30 XBH subfamily.",

    "abstract": "In Arabidopsis, HESO1 and URT1 act cooperatively on unmethylated miRNA and mRNA uridylation to induce their degradation. Their collaboration significantly impacts RNA metabolism in plants. However, the molecular mechanism determining the functional difference and complementarity of these two enzymes remains unclear. We previously solved the three-dimensional structure of URT1 in the absence and presence of UTP. In this study, we further determined the structure of URT1 in complex with a 5'-AAAU-3' RNA stretch that mimics the post-catalytic state of the mRNA poly(A) tail after the addition of the first uridine. Structural analysis and enzymatic assays revealed that L527 and Y592 endow URT1 with a preference to interact with purine over pyrimidine at the -1 RNA binding position, thus controlling the optimal number of uridine added to the 3' extremity of poly(A) as two. In addition, we observed that a large-scale conformational rearrangement in URT1 occurs upon binding with RNA from an 'open' to a 'closed' state. Molecular dynamic simulation supports an open-closed conformational selection mechanism employed by URT1 to interact with RNA substrates and maintain distributive enzymatic activity. Based on the above results, a model regarding the catalytic cycle of URT1 is proposed to explain its di-uridylation activity.",

    "abstract": "RbgA is an essential protein for the assembly of the 50S subunit in Bacillus subtilis. Depletion of RbgA leads to the accumulation of the 45S intermediate. A strain expressing a RbgA variant with reduced GTPase activity generates spontaneous suppressor mutations in uL6. Each suppressor strain accumulates a unique 44S intermediate. We reasoned that characterizing the structure of these mutant 44S intermediates may explain why RbgA is required to catalyze the folding of the 50S functional sites. We found that in the 44S particles, rRNA helices H42 and H97, near the binding site of uL6, adopt a flexible conformation and allow the central protuberance and functional sites in the mutant 44S particles to mature in any order. Instead, the wild-type 45S particles exhibit a stable H42-H97 interaction and their functional sites always mature last. The dependence on RbgA was also less pronounced in the 44S particles. We concluded that the binding of uL6 pauses the maturation of the functional sites, but the central protuberance continues to fold. RbgA exclusively binds intermediates with a formed central protuberance and licenses the folding of the functional sites. Through this mechanism, RbgA ensures that the functional sites of the 50S mature last.",

    "abstract": "The target DNA specificity of the CRISPR-associated genome editor nuclease Cas9 is determined by complementarity to a 20-nucleotide segment in its guide RNA. However, Cas9 can bind and cleave partially complementary off-target sequences, which raises safety concerns for its use in clinical applications. Here, we report crystallographic structures of Cas9 bound to bona fide off-target substrates, revealing that off-target binding is enabled by a range of noncanonical base-pairing interactions within the guide:off-target heteroduplex. Off-target substrates containing single-nucleotide deletions relative to the guide RNA are accommodated by base skipping or multiple noncanonical base pairs rather than RNA bulge formation. Finally, PAM-distal mismatches result in duplex unpairing and induce a conformational change in the Cas9 REC lobe that perturbs its conformational activation. Together, these insights provide a structural rationale for the off-target activity of Cas9 and contribute to the improved rational design of guide RNAs and off-target prediction algorithms.",

    "abstract": "ADARs (adenosine deaminases acting on RNA) can be directed to sites in the transcriptome by complementary guide strands allowing for the correction of disease-causing mutations at the RNA level. However, ADARs show bias against editing adenosines with a guanosine 5' nearest neighbor (5'-GA sites), limiting the scope of this approach. Earlier studies suggested this effect arises from a clash in the RNA minor groove involving the 2-amino group of the guanosine adjacent to an editing site. Here we show that nucleosides capable of pairing with guanosine in a syn conformation enhance editing for 5'-GA sites. We describe the crystal structure of a fragment of human ADAR2 bound to RNA bearing a G:G pair adjacent to an editing site. The two guanosines form a Gsyn:Ganti pair solving the steric problem by flipping the 2-amino group of the guanosine adjacent to the editing site into the major groove. Also, duplexes with 2'-deoxyadenosine and 3-deaza-2'-deoxyadenosine displayed increased editing efficiency, suggesting the formation of a Gsyn:AH+anti pair. This was supported by X-ray crystallography of an ADAR complex with RNA bearing a G:3-deaza dA pair. This study shows how non-Watson-Crick pairing in duplex RNA can facilitate ADAR editing enabling the design of next generation guide strands for therapeutic RNA editing.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer remains one of the deadliest forms of cancer with a 5-year survival rate of only 11%. Difficult diagnosis and limited treatment options are the major causes of the poor outcome for pancreatic cancer. The human protein DNAJA1 has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer, but its cellular and biological functions remain unclear. Previous studies have suggested that DNAJA1's cellular activity may be dependent upon its protein binding partners. To further investigate this assertion, the first 107 amino acid structures of DNAJA1 were solved by NMR, which includes the classical J-domain and its associated linker region that is proposed to be vital to DNAJA1 functionality. The DNAJA1 NMR structure was then used to identify both protein and ligand binding sites and potential binding partners that may suggest the intracellular roles of DNAJA1. Virtual drug screenings followed by NMR and isothermal titration calorimetry identified 5 drug-like compounds that bind to two different sites on DNAJA1. A pull-down assay identified 8 potentially novel protein binding partners of DNAJA1. These proteins in conjunction with our previously published metabolomics study support a vital role for DNAJA1 in cellular oncogenesis and pancreatic cancer.",

    "abstract": "During bacterial cell division, filaments of tubulin-like FtsZ form the Z-ring, which is the cytoplasmic scaffold for divisome assembly. In Escherichia coli, the actin homologue FtsA anchors the Z-ring to the membrane and recruits divisome components, including bitopic FtsN. FtsN regulates the periplasmic peptidoglycan synthase FtsWI. To characterize how FtsA regulates FtsN, we applied electron microscopy to show that E. coli FtsA forms antiparallel double filaments on lipid monolayers when bound to the cytoplasmic tail of FtsN. Using X-ray crystallography, we demonstrate that Vibrio maritimus FtsA crystallizes as an equivalent double filament. We identified an FtsA-FtsN interaction site in the IA-IC interdomain cleft of FtsA using X-ray crystallography and confirmed that FtsA forms double filaments in vivo by site-specific cysteine cross-linking. FtsA-FtsN double filaments reconstituted in or on liposomes prefer negative Gaussian curvature, like those of MreB, the actin-like protein of the elongasome. We propose that curved antiparallel FtsA double filaments together with treadmilling FtsZ filaments organize septal peptidoglycan synthesis in the division plane.",

    "abstract": "SPACA6 is a sperm-expressed surface protein that is critical for gamete fusion during mammalian sexual reproduction. Despite this fundamental role, little is known about how SPACA6 specifically functions. We elucidated the crystal structure of the SPACA6 ectodomain at 2.2-\u00c5 resolution, revealing a two-domain protein containing a four-helix bundle and Ig-like \u03b2-sandwich connected via a quasi-flexible linker. This structure is reminiscent of IZUMO1, another gamete fusion-associated protein, making SPACA6 and IZUMO1 founding members of a superfamily of fertilization-associated proteins, herein dubbed the IST superfamily. The IST superfamily is defined structurally by its distorted four-helix bundle and a pair of disulfide-bonded CXXC motifs. A structure-based search of the AlphaFold human proteome identified more protein members to this superfamily; remarkably, many of these proteins are linked to gamete fusion. The SPACA6 structure and its connection to other IST-superfamily members provide a missing link in our knowledge of mammalian gamete fusion.",

This approach provides new routes to functional synthetic polypeptides, including designs to target and bind proteins of interest. Much of this work has been developed in vitro. Therefore, a challenge is to deliver de novo polypeptides efficiently to sites of action within cells. Here we describe the design, characterisation, intracellular delivery, and subcellular localisation of a de novo synthetic peptide system. This system comprises a dual-function basic peptide, programmed both for cell penetration and target binding, and a complementary acidic peptide that can be fused to proteins of interest and introduced into cells using synthetic DNA. The designs are characterised in vitro using biophysical methods and X-ray crystallography. The utility of the system for delivery into mammalian cells and subcellular targeting is demonstrated by marking organelles and actively engaging functional protein complexes.",

    "abstract": "Oligonucleotides that target mRNA have great promise as therapeutic agents for life-threatening conditions but suffer from poor bioavailability, hence high cost. As currently untreatable diseases come within the reach of oligonucleotide therapies, new analogues are urgently needed to address this. With this in mind we describe reduced-charge oligonucleotides containing artificial LNA-amide linkages with improved gymnotic cell uptake, RNA affinity, stability and potency. To construct such oligonucleotides, five LNA-amide monomers (A, T, C, 5mC and G), where the 3'-OH is replaced by an ethanoic acid group, are synthesised in good yield and used in solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis to form amide linkages with high efficiency. The artificial backbone causes minimal structural deviation to the DNA:RNA duplex. These studies indicate that splice-switching oligonucleotides containing LNA-amide linkages and phosphorothioates display improved activity relative to oligonucleotides lacking amides, highlighting the therapeutic potential of this technology.",

The TIM barrel protein, imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase from the hyperthermophilic organism Thermotoga maritima (tHisF), is well-suited for the construction of artificial metalloenzymes by this approach. To this end, we have generated a tHisF variant (tHisF<sup>EHH</sup>) with a Glu/His/His motif for metal ion coordination. Crystal structures of Zn<sup>II</sup>:tHisF<sup>EHH</sup> and Ni<sup>II</sup>:tHisF<sup>EHH</sup> reveal that both metal ions bind to the engineered histidines. However, the two metals bind at distinct sites with different geometries, demonstrating the adaptability of tHisF. Only Zn<sup>II</sup> additionally ligates the Glu residue and adopts a tetrahedral geometry. The pseudo-octahedral Ni<sup>II</sup> site comprises the two His and a native Ser residue. Ni<sup>II</sup>:tHisF<sup>EHH</sup> catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of the flavanols quercetin and myricetin, providing an unprecedented example of an artificial metalloprotein with quercetinase activity.",

    "abstract": "Integrins are validated drug targets with six approved therapeutics. However, small-molecule inhibitors to three integrins failed in late-stage clinical trials for chronic indications. Such unfavorable outcomes may in part be caused by partial agonism, i.e., the stabilization of the high-affinity, extended-open integrin conformation. Here, we show that the failed, small-molecule inhibitors of integrins \u03b1IIb\u03b23 and \u03b14\u03b21 stabilize the high-affinity conformation. Furthermore, we discovered a simple chemical feature present in multiple \u03b1IIb\u03b23 antagonists that stabilizes integrins in their bent-closed conformation. Closing inhibitors contain a polar nitrogen atom that stabilizes, via hydrogen bonds, a water molecule that intervenes between a serine residue and the metal in the metal-ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS). Expulsion of this water is a requisite for transition to the open conformation. This change in metal coordination is general to integrins, suggesting broad applicability of the drug-design principle to the integrin family, as validated with a distantly related integrin, \u03b14\u03b21.",

    "abstract": "To correctly aminoacylate tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>, leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) catalyzes three reactions: activation of leucine by ATP to form leucyl-adenylate (Leu-AMP), transfer of this amino acid to tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> and post-transfer editing of any mischarged product. Although LeuRS has been well characterized biochemically, detailed structural information is currently only available for the latter two stages of catalysis. We have solved crystal structures for all enzymatic states of Neisseria gonorrhoeae LeuRS during Leu-AMP formation. These show a cycle of dramatic conformational changes, involving multiple domains, and correlate with an energetically unfavorable peptide-plane flip observed in the active site of the pre-transition state structure. Biochemical analyses, combined with mutant structural studies, reveal that this backbone distortion acts as a trigger, temporally compartmentalizing the first two catalytic steps. These results unveil the remarkable effect of this small structural alteration on the global dynamics and activity of the enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Copper amine oxidase from <i>Arthrobacter globiformis</i> (AGAO) catalyses the oxidative deamination of primary amines <i>via</i> a large conformational change of a topaquinone (TPQ) cofactor during the semiquinone formation step. This conformational change of TPQ occurs in the presence of strong hydrogen bonds and neighboring bulky amino acids, especially the conserved Asn381, which restricts TPQ conformational changes over the catalytic cycle. Whether such a semiquinone intermediate is catalytically active or inert has been a matter of debate in copper amine oxidases. Here, we show that the reaction rate of the Asn381Ala mutant decreases 160-fold, and the X-ray crystal structures of the mutant reveals a TPQ-flipped conformation in both the oxidized and reduced states, preceding semiquinone formation. Our hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations show that the TPQ conformational change is realized through the sequential steps of the TPQ ring-rotation and slide. We determine that the bulky side chain of Asn381 hinders the undesired TPQ ring-rotation in the oxidized form, favoring the TPQ ring-rotation in reduced TPQ by a further stabilization leading to the TPQ semiquinone form. The acquired conformational flexibility of TPQ semiquinone promotes a high reactivity of Cu(i) to O<sub>2</sub>, suggesting that the semiquinone form is catalytically active for the subsequent oxidative half-reaction in AGAO. The ingenious molecular mechanism exerted by TPQ to achieve the \"state-specific\" reaction sheds new light on a drastic environmental transformation around the catalytic center.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between a T cell receptor (TCR) and a peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) ligand are typically mediated by noncovalent bonds. By studying T cells expressing natural or engineered TCRs, here we describe covalent TCR-pMHC interactions that involve a cysteine-cysteine disulfide bond between the TCR and the peptide. By introducing cysteines into a known TCR-pMHC combination, we demonstrate that disulfide bond formation does not require structural rearrangement of the TCR or the peptide. We further show these disulfide bonds still form even when the initial affinity of the TCR-pMHC interaction is low. Accordingly, TCR-peptide disulfide bonds facilitate T cell activation by pMHC ligands with a wide spectrum of affinities for the TCR. Physiologically, this mechanism induces strong Zap70-dependent TCR signaling, which triggers T cell deletion or agonist selection in the thymus cortex. Covalent TCR-pMHC interactions may thus underlie a physiological T cell activation mechanism that has applications in basic immunology and potentially in immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "The opportunistic pathogen <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> causes antibiotic-resistant, nosocomial infections in immuno-compromised individuals and is a high priority for antimicrobial development. Key to pathogenicity in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> are biofilm formation and virulence factor production. Both traits are controlled by the cell-to-cell communication process called quorum sensing (QS). QS involves the synthesis, release, and population-wide detection of signal molecules called autoinducers. We previously reported that the activity of the RhlR QS transcription factor depends on a protein-protein interaction with the hydrolase, PqsE, and PqsE catalytic activity is dispensable for this interaction. Nonetheless, the PqsE-RhlR interaction could be disrupted by the substitution of an active site glutamate residue with tryptophan [PqsE(E182W)]. Here, we show that disruption of the PqsE-RhlR interaction via either the E182W change or alteration of PqsE surface residues that are essential for the interaction with RhlR attenuates <i>P. aeruginosa</i> infection in a murine host. We use crystallography to characterize the conformational changes induced by the PqsE(E182W) substitution to define the mechanism underlying disruption of the PqsE-RhlR interaction. A loop rearrangement that repositions the E280 residue in PqsE(E182W) is responsible for the loss of interaction. We verify the implications garnered from the PqsE(E182W) structure using mutagenic, biochemical, and additional structural analyses. We present the next generation of molecules targeting the PqsE active site, including a structure of the tightest binding of these compounds, BB584, in complex with PqsE. The findings presented here provide insights into drug discovery against <i>P. aeruginosa</i> with PqsE as the target.",

    "abstract": "Nitrile hydratases (NHases) are important biocatalysts for the enzymatic conversion of nitriles to industrially-important amides such as acrylamide and nicotinamide. Although thermostability in this enzyme class is generally low, there is not sufficient understanding of its basis for rational enzyme design. The gene expressing the Co-type NHase from the moderate thermophile, <i>Geobacillus pallidus</i> RAPc8 (NRRL B-59396), was subjected to random mutagenesis. Four mutants were selected that were 3 to 15-fold more thermostable than the wild-type NHase, resulting in a 3.4-7.6\u00a0\u200bkJ/mol increase in the activation energy of thermal inactivation at 63\u00a0\u200b\u00b0C. High resolution X-ray crystal structures (1.15-1.80\u00a0\u200b\u00c5) were obtained of the wild-type and four mutant enzymes. Mutant 9E, with a resolution of 1.15\u00a0\u200b\u00c5, is the highest resolution crystal structure obtained for a nitrile hydratase to date. Structural comparisons between the wild-type and mutant enzymes illustrated the importance of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds in enhancing NHase thermostability. These additional interactions variously improved thermostability by increased intra- and inter-subunit interactions, preventing cooperative unfolding of \u03b1-helices and stabilising loop regions. Some hydrogen bonds were mediated via a water molecule, specifically highlighting the significance of structured water molecules in protein thermostability. Although knowledge of the mutant structures makes it possible to rationalize their behaviour, it would have been challenging to predict in advance that these mutants would be stabilising.",

    "abstract": "The mesophilic cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 encodes an S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase (SAHase) of archaeal origin in its genome. SAHases are essential enzymes involved in the regulation of cellular S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methylation reactions. They are usually active as homotetramers or, less commonly, as homodimers. A SAHase subunit is composed of two major domains: a cofactor (NAD<sup>+</sup>)-binding domain and a substrate (S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine)-binding domain. These are connected by a hinge element that is also a coordination site for an alkali-metal cation that influences domain movement during the catalytic cycle. Typically, the highest activity and strongest substrate binding of bacterial SAHases are observed in the presence of K<sup>+</sup> ions. The SAHase from Synechocystis (SynSAHase) is an exception in this respect. Enzymatic and isothermal titration calorimetry studies demonstrated that in contrast to K<sup>+</sup>-dependent SAHases, the activity and ligand binding of SynSAHase are not affected by the presence of any particular alkali ion. Moreover, in contrast to other SAHases, the cyanobacterial enzyme is in an equilibrium of two distinct oligomeric states corresponding to its dimeric and tetrameric forms in solution. To explain these phenomena, crystal structures of SynSAHase were determined for the enzyme crystallized in the presence of adenosine (a reaction byproduct or substrate) and sodium or rubidium cations. The structural data confirm that while SynSAHase shares common structural features with other SAHases, no alkali metal is coordinated by the cyanobacterial enzyme as a result of a different organization of the macromolecular environment of the site that is normally supposed to coordinate the metal cation. This inspired the generation of SynSAHase mutants that bind alkali-metal cations analogously to K<sup>+</sup>-dependent SAHases, as confirmed by crystallographic studies. Structural comparisons of the crystal structure of SynSAHase with other experimental models of SAHases suggest a possible explanation for the occurrence of the cyanobacterial enzyme in the tetrameric state. On the other hand, the reason for the existence of SynSAHase in the dimeric state in solution remains elusive.",

    "abstract": "Glutathione transferases (GSTs) constitute a widespread superfamily of enzymes notably involved in xenobiotic detoxification and/or in specialized metabolism. <i>Populus trichocarpa</i> genome (V4.1 assembly, Phytozome 13) consists of 74 genes coding for full-length GSTs and ten likely pseudogenes. These GSTs are divided into 11 classes, in which the tau class (GSTU) is the most abundant with 54 isoforms. PtGSTU19 and 20, two paralogs sharing more than 91% sequence identity (95% of sequence similarity), would have diverged from a common ancestor of <i>P. trichocarpa</i> and <i>P. yatungensis</i> species. These enzymes display the distinctive glutathione (GSH)-conjugation and peroxidase activities against model substrates. The resolution of the crystal structures of these proteins revealed significant structural differences despite their high sequence identity. PtGSTU20 has a well-defined deep pocket in the active site whereas the bottom of this pocket is disordered in PtGSTU19. In a screen of potential ligands, we were able to identify an interaction with flavonoids. Some of them, previously identified in poplar (chrysin, galangin, and pinocembrin), inhibited GSH-conjugation activity of both enzymes with a more pronounced effect on PtGSTU20. The crystal structures of PtGSTU20 complexed with these molecules provide evidence for their potential involvement in flavonoid transport in <i>P. trichocarpa</i>.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants have generated a worldwide health crisis due to resistance to most approved SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and evasion of vaccination-induced antibodies. To manage Omicron subvariants and prepare for new ones, additional means of isolating broad and potent humanized SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies are desirable. Here, we describe a mouse model in which the primary B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire is generated solely through V(D)J recombination of a human V<sub>H</sub>1-2 heavy chain (HC) and, substantially, a human V\u03ba1-33 light chain (LC). Thus, primary humanized BCR repertoire diversity in these mice derives from immensely diverse HC and LC antigen-contact CDR3 sequences generated by nontemplated junctional modifications during V(D)J recombination. Immunizing this mouse model with SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1) spike protein immunogens elicited several V<sub>H</sub>1-2/V\u03ba1-33-based neutralizing antibodies that bound RBD in a different mode from each other and from those of many prior patient-derived V<sub>H</sub>1-2-based neutralizing antibodies. Of these, SP1-77 potently and broadly neutralized all SARS-CoV-2 variants through BA.5. Cryo-EM studies revealed that SP1-77 bound RBD away from the receptor-binding motif via a CDR3-dominated recognition mode. Lattice light-sheet microscopy-based studies showed that SP1-77 did not block ACE2-mediated viral attachment or endocytosis but rather blocked viral-host membrane fusion. The broad and potent SP1-77 neutralization activity and nontraditional mechanism of action suggest that it might have therapeutic potential. Likewise, the SP1-77 binding epitope may inform vaccine strategies. Last, the type of humanized mouse models that we have described may contribute to identifying therapeutic antibodies against future SARS-CoV-2 variants and other pathogens.",

While cytoplasmic FBA has been extensively studied in non-photosynthetic organisms, functional and structural details are limited for chloroplast FBA encoded by oxygenic phototrophs. Here we determined the crystal structure of plastidial FBA from the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Cr).

    "abstract": "Human spermine oxidase (hSMOX) plays a central role in polyamine catabolism. Due to its association with several pathological processes, including inflammation and cancer, hSMOX has garnered interest as a possible therapeutic target. Therefore, determination of the structure of hSMOX is an important step to enable drug discovery and validate hSMOX as a drug target. Using insights from hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), we engineered a hSMOX construct to obtain the first crystal structure of hSMOX bound to the known polyamine oxidase inhibitor MDL72527 at 2.4\u2009\u00c5 resolution. While the overall fold of hSMOX is similar to its homolog, murine N1-acetylpolyamine oxidase (mPAOX), the two structures contain significant differences, notably in their substrate-binding domains and active site pockets. Subsequently, we employed a sensitive biochemical assay to conduct a high-throughput screen that identified a potent and selective hSMOX inhibitor, JNJ-1289. The co-crystal structure of hSMOX with JNJ-1289 was determined at 2.1\u2009\u00c5 resolution, revealing that JNJ-1289 binds to an allosteric site, providing JNJ-1289 with a high degree of selectivity towards hSMOX. These results provide crucial insights into understanding the substrate specificity and enzymatic mechanism of hSMOX, and for the design of highly selective inhibitors.",

The rapid emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants challenges the currently available therapeutics for clinical application. Nonstructural proteins (also known as replicase proteins) with versatile biological functions play central roles in viral replication and transcription inside the host cells, and they are the most conserved target proteins among the SARS-CoV-2 variants. Specifically, they constitute the replication-transcription complexes (RTCs) dominating the synthesis of viral RNA. Knowledge of themolecular mechanisms of nonstructural proteins and their assembly into RTCs will benefit the development of antivirals targeting them against existing or potentially emerging variants. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of the structures and functions of coronavirus nonstructural proteins as well as the assembly and functions of RTCs in the life cycle of the virus.",

    "abstract": "Streptomyces coelicolor (Sc) is a model organism of actinobacteria to study morphological differentiation and production of bioactive metabolites. Sc zinc uptake regulator (Zur) affects both processes by controlling zinc homeostasis. It activates transcription by binding to palindromic Zur-box sequences upstream of -35 elements. Here we deciphered the molecular mechanism by which ScZur interacts with promoter DNA and Sc RNA polymerase (RNAP) by cryo-EM structures and biochemical assays. The ScZur-DNA structures reveal a sequential and cooperative binding of three ScZur dimers surrounding a Zur-box spaced 8 nt upstream from a -35 element. The ScRNAP\u03c3HrdB-Zur-DNA structures define protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions involved in the principal housekeeping \u03c3HrdB-dependent transcription initiation from a noncanonical promoter with a -10 element lacking the critical adenine residue at position -11 and a TTGCCC -35 element deviating from the canonical TTGACA motif. ScZur interacts with the C-terminal domain of ScRNAP \u03b1 subunit (\u03b1CTD) in a complex structure trapped in an active conformation. Key ScZur-\u03b1CTD interfacial residues accounting for ScZur-dependent transcription activation were confirmed by mutational studies. Together, our structural and biochemical results provide a comprehensive model for transcription activation of Zur family regulators.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 variants with adaptive mutations have continued to emerge, causing fresh waves of infection even amongst vaccinated population. The development of broad-spectrum antivirals is thus urgently needed. We previously developed two hetero-bivalent nanobodies (Nbs), aRBD-2-5 and aRBD-2-7, with potent neutralization activity against the wild-type (WT) Wuhan isolated SARS-CoV-2, by fusing aRBD-2 with aRBD-5 and aRBD-7, respectively. Here, we resolved the crystal structures of these Nbs in complex with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, and found that aRBD-2 contacts with highly-conserved RBD residues and retains binding to the RBD of the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Delta plus, Kappa, Lambda, Omicron BA.1, and BA.2 variants. In contrast, aRBD-5 and aRBD-7 bind to less-conserved RBD epitopes non-overlapping with the epitope of aRBD-2, and do not show apparent binding to the RBD of some variants. However, when fused with aRBD-2, they effectively enhance the overall binding affinity. Consistently, aRBD-2-5-Fc and aRBD-2-7-Fc potently neutralized all of the tested authentic or pseudotyped viruses, including WT, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron BA.1, BA.1.1 and BA.2. Furthermore, aRBD-2-5-Fc provided prophylactic protection against the WT and mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 in mice, and conferred protection against the Omicron BA.1 variant in hamsters prophylactically and therapeutically, indicating that aRBD-2-5-Fc could potentially benefit the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 caused by the emerging variants of concern. Our strategy provides new solutions in the development of broad-spectrum therapeutic antibodies for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Continuous developments in cryogenic X-ray crystallography have provided most of our knowledge of 3D protein structures, which has recently been further augmented by revolutionary advances in cryoEM. However, a single structural conformation identified at cryogenic temperatures may introduce a fictitious structure as a result of cryogenic cooling artefacts, limiting the overview of inherent protein physiological dynamics, which play a critical role in the biological functions of proteins. Here, a room-temperature X-ray crystallographic method using temperature as a trigger to record movie-like structural snapshots has been developed. The method has been used to show how TL00150, a 175.15\u2005Da fragment, undergoes binding-mode changes in endothiapepsin. A surprising fragment-binding discrepancy was observed between the cryo-cooled and physiological temperature structures, and multiple binding poses and their interplay with DMSO were captured. The observations here open up new promising prospects for structure determination and interpretation at physiological temperatures with implications for structure-based drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Thermophilic polyester hydrolases (PES-H) have recently enabled biocatalytic recycling of the mass-produced synthetic polyester polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which has found widespread use in the packaging and textile industries. The growing demand for efficient PET hydrolases prompted us to solve high-resolution crystal structures of two metagenome-derived enzymes (PES-H1 and PES-H2) and notably also in complex with various PET substrate analogues. Structural analyses and computational modeling using molecular dynamics simulations provided an understanding of how product inhibition and multiple substrate binding modes influence key mechanistic steps of enzymatic PET hydrolysis. Key residues involved in substrate-binding and those identified previously as mutational hotspots in homologous enzymes were subjected to mutagenesis. At 72 \u00b0C, the L92F/Q94Y variant of PES-H1 exhibited 2.3-fold and 3.4-fold improved hydrolytic activity against amorphous PET films and pretreated real-world PET waste, respectively. The R204C/S250C variant of PES-H1 had a 6.4 \u00b0C higher melting temperature than the wild-type enzyme but retained similar hydrolytic activity. Under optimal reaction conditions, the L92F/Q94Y variant of PES-H1 hydrolyzed low-crystallinity PET materials 2.2-fold more efficiently than LCC ICCG, which was previously the most active PET hydrolase reported in the literature. This property makes the L92F/Q94Y variant of PES-H1 a good candidate for future applications in industrial plastic recycling processes.",

    "abstract": "Allergies have become a rising health problem, where plentiful substances can trigger IgE-mediated allergies in humans. While profilins are considered minor allergens, these ubiquitous proteins are primary molecules involved in cross-reactivity and pollen-food allergy syndrome. Here we report the first crystal structures of murine Fab/IgE, with its chains naturally paired, in complex with the allergen profilin from Hevea brasiliensis (Hev b 8). The crystallographic models revealed that the IgE's six complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) interact with the allergen, comprising a rigid paratope-epitope surface of 926 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>, which includes an extensive network of interactions. Interestingly, we also observed previously unreported flexibility at Fab/IgE's elbow angle, which did not influence the shape of the paratope. The Fab/IgE exhibits a high affinity for Hev b 8, even when using 1\u2009M NaCl in BLI experiments. Finally, based on the encouraging cross-reactivity assays using two mutants of the maize profilin (Zea m 12), this antibody could be a promising tool in IgE engineering for diagnosis and research applications.",

    "abstract": "The clinical manufacturing of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells includes cell selection, activation, gene transduction, and expansion. While the method of T-cell selection varies across companies, current methods do not actively eliminate the cancer cells in the patient's apheresis product from the healthy immune cells. Alarmingly, it has been found that transduction of a single leukemic B cell with the CAR gene can confer resistance to CAR T-cell therapy and lead to treatment failure. In this study, we report the identification of a novel high-affinity DNA aptamer, termed tJBA8.1, that binds transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), a receptor broadly upregulated by cancer cells. Using competition assays, high resolution cryo-EM, and <i>de novo</i> model building of the aptamer into the resulting electron density, we reveal that tJBA8.1 shares a binding site on TfR1 with holo-transferrin, the natural ligand of TfR1. We use tJBA8.1 to effectively deplete B lymphoma cells spiked into peripheral blood mononuclear cells with minimal impact on the healthy immune cell composition. Lastly, we present opportunities for affinity improvement of tJBA8.1. As TfR1 expression is broadly upregulated in many cancers, including difficult-to-treat T-cell leukemias and lymphomas, our work provides a facile, universal, and inexpensive approach for comprehensively removing cancerous cells from patient apheresis products for safe manufacturing of adoptive T-cell therapies.",

    "abstract": "The AAA<sup>+</sup> family member KaiC is the central pacemaker for circadian rhythms in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus. Composed of two hexameric rings of adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) domains with tightly coupled activities, KaiC undergoes a cycle of autophosphorylation and autodephosphorylation on its C-terminal (CII) domain that restricts binding of clock proteins on its N-terminal (CI) domain to the evening. Here, we use cryogenic-electron microscopy to investigate how daytime and nighttime states of CII regulate KaiB binding on CI. We find that the CII hexamer is destabilized during the day but takes on a rigidified C<sub>2</sub>-symmetric state at night, concomitant with ring-ring compression. Residues at the CI-CII interface are required for phospho-dependent KaiB association, coupling ATPase activity on CI to cooperative KaiB recruitment. Together, these studies clarify a key step in the regulation of cyanobacterial circadian rhythms by KaiC phosphorylation.",

    "abstract": "Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is a pivotal enzyme of the transsulfuration pathway responsible for diverting homocysteine to the biosynthesis of cysteine and production of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S). Aberrant upregulation of CBS and overproduction of H<sub>2</sub>S contribute to pathophysiology of several diseases including cancer and Down syndrome. Therefore, pharmacological CBS inhibition has emerged as a prospective therapeutic approach. Here, we characterized binding and inhibitory mechanism of aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), the most commonly used CBS inhibitor. We found that AOAA binds CBS tighter than its respective substrates and forms a dead-end PLP-bound intermediate featuring an oxime bond. Surprisingly, serine, but not cysteine, replaced AOAA from CBS and formed an aminoacrylate reaction intermediate, which allowed for the continuation of the catalytic cycle. Indeed, serine rescued and essentially normalized the enzymatic activity of AOAA-inhibited CBS. Cellular studies confirmed that AOAA decreased H<sub>2</sub>S production and bioenergetics, while additional serine rescued CBS activity, H<sub>2</sub>S production and mitochondrial function. The crystal structure of AOAA-bound human CBS showed a lack of hydrogen bonding with residues G305 and Y308, found in the serine-bound model. Thus, AOAA-inhibited CBS could be reactivated by serine. This difference may be important in a cellular environment in multiple pathophysiological conditions and may modulate the CBS-inhibitory activity of AOAA. In addition, our results demonstrate additional complexities of using AOAA as a CBS-specific inhibitor of H<sub>2</sub>S biogenesis and point to the urgent need to develop a potent, selective and specific pharmacological CBS inhibitor.",

    "abstract": "Many enzymes utilize redox-coupled centers for performing catalysis where these centers are used to control and regulate the transfer of electrons required for catalysis, whose untimely delivery can lead to a state incapable of binding the substrate, i.e., a dead-end enzyme. Copper nitrite reductases (CuNiRs), which catalyze the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide (NO), have proven to be a good model system for studying these complex processes including proton-coupled electron transfer (ET) and their orchestration for substrate binding/utilization. Recently, a two-domain CuNiR from a <i>Rhizobia</i> species (<i>Br</i><sup>2D</sup>NiR) has been discovered with a substantially lower enzymatic activity where the catalytic type-2 Cu (T2Cu) site is occupied by two water molecules requiring their displacement for the substrate nitrite to bind. Single crystal spectroscopy combined with MSOX (multiple structures from one crystal) for both the as-isolated and nitrite-soaked crystals clearly demonstrate that inter-Cu ET within the coupled T1Cu-T2Cu redox system is heavily gated. Laser-flash photolysis and optical spectroscopy showed rapid ET from photoexcited NADH to the T1Cu center but little or no inter-Cu ET in the absence of nitrite. Furthermore, incomplete reoxidation of the T1Cu site (\u223c20% electrons transferred) was observed in the presence of nitrite, consistent with a slow formation of NO species in the serial structures of the MSOX movie obtained from the nitrite-soaked crystal, which is likely to be responsible for the lower activity of this CuNiR. Our approach is of direct relevance for studying redox reactions in a wide range of biological systems including metalloproteins that make up at least 30% of all proteins.",

Here we present the cryogenic electron microscopy structures of human Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 alone and bound to a selective pore blocker, A-803467, at overall resolutions of 2.7 to 3.2 \u00c5. The first voltage-sensing domain (VSD<sub>I</sub>) displays three different conformations. Structure-guided mutagenesis identified the extracellular interface between VSD<sub>I</sub> and the pore domain (PD) to be a determinant for the high-voltage dependence of activation. A-803467 was clearly resolved in the central cavity of the PD, clenching S6<sub>IV</sub>. Our structure-guided functional characterizations show that two nonligand binding residues, Thr397 on S6<sub>I</sub> and Gly1406 on S6<sub>III</sub>, allosterically modulate the channel's sensitivity to A-803467. Comparison of available structures of human Na<sub>v</sub> channels suggests the extracellular loop region to be a potential site for developing subtype-specific pore-blocking biologics.",

    "abstract": "Cryo-cooling has been nearly universally adopted to mitigate X-ray damage and facilitate crystal handling in protein X-ray crystallography. However, cryo X-ray crystallographic data provide an incomplete window into the ensemble of conformations that is at the heart of protein function and energetics. Room-temperature (RT) X-ray crystallography provides accurate ensemble information, and recent developments allow conformational heterogeneity (the experimental manifestation of ensembles) to be extracted from single-crystal data. Nevertheless, high sensitivity to X-ray damage at RT raises concerns about data reliability. To systematically address this critical issue, increasingly X-ray-damaged high-resolution data sets (1.02-1.52\u2005\u00c5 resolution) were obtained from single proteinase K, thaumatin and lysozyme crystals at RT (277\u2005K). In each case a modest increase in conformational heterogeneity with X-ray damage was observed. Merging data with different extents of damage (as is typically carried out) had negligible effects on conformational heterogeneity until the overall diffraction intensity decayed to \u223c70% of its initial value. These effects were compared with X-ray damage effects in cryo-cooled crystals by carrying out an analogous analysis of increasingly damaged proteinase K cryo data sets (0.9-1.16\u2005\u00c5 resolution). X-ray damage-associated heterogeneity changes were found that were not observed at RT. This property renders it difficult to distinguish real from artefactual conformations and to determine the conformational response to changes in temperature. The ability to acquire reliable heterogeneity information from single crystals at RT, together with recent advances in RT data collection at accessible synchrotron beamlines, provides a strong motivation for the widespread adoption of RT X-ray crystallography to obtain conformational ensemble information.",

The distinct T-shaped conformation of membrane-bound ankyrin-1 facilitates recognition of RhCE and, unexpectedly, the water channel aquaporin-1.

Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is an aggressive childhood soft tissue sarcoma transformed by the pathognomonic Paired Box 3-Forkhead Box O1 (PAX3-FOXO1) fusion protein, which governs a core regulatory circuitry transcription factor network. Here, we show that the histone lysine demethylase 4B (KDM4B) is a therapeutic vulnerability for PAX3-FOXO1<sup>+</sup> RMS. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of KDM4B substantially delayed tumor growth. Suppression of KDM4 proteins inhibited the expression of core oncogenic transcription factors and caused epigenetic alterations of PAX3-FOXO1-governed superenhancers. Combining KDM4 inhibition with cytotoxic chemotherapy led to tumor regression in preclinical PAX3-FOXO1<sup>+</sup> RMS subcutaneous xenograft models. In summary, we identified a targetable mechanism required for maintenance of the PAX3-FOXO1-related transcription factor network, which may translate to a therapeutic approach for fusion-positive RMS.",

Despite targeting a conserved motif, only some mAbs show broad neutralizing activity in vitro against alpha- and betacoronaviruses, including animal coronaviruses WIV-1 and PDF-2180. Two selected mAbs also neutralize Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 authentic viruses and reduce viral burden and pathology in vivo. Structural and functional analyses showed that the fusion peptide-specific mAbs bound with different modalities to a cryptic epitope hidden in prefusion stabilized spike, which became exposed upon binding of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) or ACE2-mimicking mAbs.",

    "abstract": "TMEM16 scramblases dissipate the plasma membrane lipid asymmetry to activate multiple eukaryotic cellular pathways. Scrambling was proposed to occur with lipid headgroups moving between leaflets through a membrane-spanning hydrophilic groove. Direct information on lipid-groove interactions is lacking. We report the 2.3\u2009\u00c5 resolution cryogenic\u00a0electron microscopy structure of the nanodisc-reconstituted Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound afTMEM16 scramblase showing how rearrangement of individual lipids at the open pathway results in pronounced membrane thinning. Only the groove's intracellular vestibule contacts lipids, and mutagenesis suggests scrambling does not require specific protein-lipid interactions with the extracellular vestibule. We find scrambling can occur outside a closed groove in thinner membranes and is inhibited in thicker membranes, despite an open pathway. Our results show afTMEM16 thins the membrane to enable scrambling and that an open hydrophilic pathway is not a structural requirement to allow rapid transbilayer movement of lipids. This mechanism could be extended to other scramblases lacking a hydrophilic groove.",

They are potential pharmaceutical targets for the treatment of several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. In this study, the catalytic and substrate-regulatory mechanisms of a novel bacterial POP from Microbulbifer arenaceous (MaPOP) were investigated. The crystal structure revealed that the catalytic triad of MaPOP was covered by the central tunnel of an unusual \u03b2-propeller domain. The tunnel not only provided the sole access to the active site for oligopeptides, but also protected large structured peptides or proteins from accidental proteolysis. The enzyme was able to cleave angiotensin I specifically at the carboxyl side of the internal proline residue, but could not hydrolyze long-chain bovine insulin B in\u00a0vitro. Like the ligand-free structure, MaPOP bound to the transition-state analog inhibitor ZPR was also in a closed state, which was not modulated by the common `latching loop' found in other POPs. The substrate-assisted catalytic mechanism of MaPOP reported here may represent a common mechanism for all POPs. These results may facilitate a better understanding of the catalytic behavior of POPs under physiological conditions.",

    "abstract": "The recently discovered lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are Cu-containing enzymes capable of degrading polysaccharide substrates oxidatively. The generally accepted first step in the LPMO reaction is the reduction of the active-site metal ion from Cu<sup>2+</sup> to Cu<sup>+</sup>. Here we have used a systematic diffraction data collection method to monitor structural changes in two AA9 LPMOs, one from <i>Lentinus similis</i> (<i>Ls</i>AA9_A) and one from <i>Thermoascus auranti-acus</i> (<i>Ta</i>AA9_A), as the active-site Cu is photoreduced in the X-ray beam. For <i>Ls</i>AA9_A, the protein produced in two different recombinant systems was crystallized to probe the effect of post-translational modifications and different crystallization conditions on the active site and metal photoreduction. We can recommend that crystallographic studies of AA9 LPMOs wishing to address the Cu<sup>2+</sup> form use a total X-ray dose below 3\u00a0\u00d7 10<sup>4</sup>\u2005Gy, while the Cu<sup>+</sup> form can be attained using 1\u00a0\u00d7 10<sup>6</sup>\u2005Gy. In all cases, we observe the transition from a hexa-coordinated Cu site with two solvent-facing ligands to a T-shaped geometry with no exogenous ligands, and a clear increase of the \u03b8<sub>2</sub> parameter and a decrease of the \u03b8<sub>3</sub> parameter by averages of 9.2\u00b0 and 8.4\u00b0, respectively, but also a slight increase in \u03b8<sub>T</sub>. Thus, the \u03b8<sub>2</sub> and \u03b8<sub>3</sub> parameters are helpful diagnostics for the oxidation state of the metal in a His-brace protein. On binding of cello-oligosaccharides to <i>Ls</i>AA9_A, regardless of the production source, the \u03b8<sub>T</sub> parameter increases, making the Cu site less planar, while the active-site Tyr-Cu distance decreases reproducibly for the Cu<sup>2+</sup> form. Thus, the \u03b8<sub>T</sub> increase found on copper reduction may bring <i>Ls</i>AA9_A closer to an oligosaccharide-bound state and contribute to the observed higher affinity of reduced <i>Ls</i>AA9_A for cellulosic substrates.",

    "abstract": "Dynamics is an essential process to drive an enzyme to perform a function. When a protein sequence encodes for its three-dimensional structure and hence its function, it essentially defines the intrinsic dynamics of the molecule. The static X-ray crystal structure was thought to shed little insight into the molecule's dynamics until the recently available tool \"Ensemble refinement\" (ER). Here, we report the structure-function-dynamics of PanPL, an alginate-specific, endolytic, allosteric polysaccharide lyase belonging to the PL-5 family from <i>Pandoraea apista</i>. The crystal structures determined in apo and tetra-ManA bound forms reveal that the PanPL maintains a closed state with an N-terminal loop lid (N-loop-lid) arched over the active site. The B-factor analyses and ER congruently reveal how pH influences the functionally relevant atomic fluctuations at the N-loop-lid. The ER unveils enhanced fluctuations at the N-loop-lid upon substrate binding. The normal-mode analysis finds that the functional states are confined. The 1 \u03bcs simulation study suggests the existence of a hidden open state. The longer N-loop-lid selects a mechanism to adopt a closed state and undergo fluctuations to facilitate the substrate binding. Here, our work demonstrates the distinct modes of dynamics; both intrinsic and substrate-induced conformational changes are vital for enzyme functioning and allostery.",

We developed a system to produce stable HIV-1 Pol and determined its cryo-electron microscopy structure. RT in Pol has a similar arrangement to the mature RT heterodimer, and its dimerization may draw together two PR monomers to activate proteolytic processing.

BMPRII is a receptor for over 15 BMP ligands, but why BMPR2 mutations cause lung-specific pathology is unknown. To elucidate the molecular basis of BMP:BMPRII interactions, we report crystal structures of binary and ternary BMPRII receptor complexes with BMP10, which contain an ensemble of seven different BMP10:BMPRII 1:1 complexes. BMPRII binds BMP10 at the knuckle epitope, with the A-loop and \u03b24 strand making BMPRII-specific interactions. The BMPRII binding surface on BMP10 is dynamic, and the affinity is weaker in the ternary complex than in the binary complex. Hydrophobic core and A-loop interactions are important in BMPRII-mediated signalling. Our data reveal how BMPRII is a low affinity receptor, implying that forming a signalling complex requires high concentrations of BMPRII, hence mutations will impact on tissues with highest BMPR2 expression such as the lung vasculature.",

    "abstract": "Actin histidine N<sup>\u03c4</sup> -methylation by histidine methyltransferase SETD3 plays an important role in human biology and diseases. Here, we report integrated synthetic, biocatalytic, biostructural, and computational analyses on human SETD3-catalyzed methylation of actin peptides possessing histidine and its structurally and chemically diverse mimics. Our enzyme assays supported by biostructural analyses demonstrate that SETD3 has a broader substrate scope beyond histidine, including N-nucleophiles on the aromatic and aliphatic side chains. Quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical molecular dynamics and free-energy simulations provide insight into binding geometries and the free energy barrier for the enzymatic methyl transfer to histidine mimics, further supporting experimental data that histidine is the superior SETD3 substrate over its analogs. This work demonstrates that human SETD3 has a potential to catalyze efficient methylation of several histidine mimics, overall providing mechanistic, biocatalytic, and functional insight into actin histidine methylation by SETD3.",

    "abstract": "Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are the key components for RNA interference (RNAi), a conserved RNA-silencing mechanism in many eukaryotes<sup>1,2</sup>. In Drosophila, an RNase III enzyme Dicer-2 (Dcr-2), aided by its cofactor Loquacious-PD (Loqs-PD), has an important role in generating 21\u2009bp siRNA duplexes from long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs)<sup>3,4</sup>. ATP hydrolysis by the helicase domain of Dcr-2 is critical to the successful processing of a long dsRNA into consecutive siRNA duplexes<sup>5,6</sup>. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of Dcr-2-Loqs-PD in the apo state and in multiple states in which it is processing a 50\u2009bp dsRNA substrate. The structures elucidated interactions between Dcr-2 and Loqs-PD, and substantial conformational changes of Dcr-2 during a dsRNA-processing cycle. The N-terminal helicase and domain of unknown function 283 (DUF283) domains undergo conformational changes after initial dsRNA binding, forming an ATP-binding pocket and a 5'-phosphate-binding pocket. The overall conformation of Dcr-2-Loqs-PD is relatively rigid during translocating along the dsRNA in the presence of ATP, whereas the interactions between the DUF283 and RIIIDb domains prevent non-specific cleavage during translocation by blocking the access of dsRNA to the RNase active centre. Additional ATP-dependent conformational changes are required to form an active dicing state and precisely cleave the dsRNA into a 21\u2009bp siRNA duplex as confirmed by the structure in the post-dicing state. Collectively, this study revealed the molecular mechanism for the full cycle of ATP-dependent dsRNA processing by Dcr-2-Loqs-PD.",

    "abstract": "Many neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) elicited to ancestral severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) through natural infection and vaccination have reduced effectiveness to SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we show that therapeutic antibody ADG20 is able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) including Omicron (B.1.1.529) as well as other SARS-related coronaviruses. We delineate the structural basis of this relatively escape-resistant epitope that extends from one end of the receptor binding site (RBS) into the highly conserved CR3022 site. ADG20 can then benefit from high potency through direct competition with ACE2 in the more variable RBS and interaction with the more highly conserved CR3022 site. Importantly, antibodies that are able to target this site generally neutralize a broad range of VOCs, albeit with reduced potency against Omicron. Thus, this conserved and vulnerable site can be exploited for the design of universal vaccines and therapeutic antibodies.",

The preparation greatly enhances the intercomplex quinone transfer activity. The structures reveal large intercomplex motions that result in different shapes and sizes of the intercomplex space between complexes I and III, forming a dynamic substrate pool. Biochemical and structural analyses indicated that intercomplex phospholipids mediate the intercomplex motions. An analysis of the different classes of focus-refined complex I showed that structural switches due to quinone reduction led to the formation of a novel channel that could transfer reduced quinones to the intercomplex substrate pool. <b><i>Innovation and Conclusion:</i></b> Our results indicate potential mechanism for the facilitated electron transfer involving a dynamic substrate pool and intercomplex movement by which supercomplexes play an active role in the regulation of metabolic flux and reactive oxygen species.",

    "abstract": "As an essential enzyme of SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 pathogen, main protease (M<sup>Pro</sup>) is a viable target to develop antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19. By varying chemical compositions at both P2 and P3 positions and the N-terminal protection group, we synthesized 18 tripeptidyl M<sup>Pro</sup> inhibitors that contained also an aldehyde warhead and \u03b2-(S-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl)-alaninal at the P1 position. Systematic characterizations of these inhibitors were conducted, including their in vitro enzymatic inhibition potency, X-ray crystal structures of their complexes with M<sup>Pro</sup>, their inhibition of M<sup>Pro</sup> transiently expressed in 293T cells, and cellular toxicity and SARS-CoV-2 antiviral potency of selected inhibitors. These inhibitors have a large variation of determined in vitro enzymatic inhibition IC<sub>50</sub> values that range from 4.8 to 650\u00a0nM. The determined in vitro enzymatic inhibition IC<sub>50</sub> values reveal that relatively small side chains at both P2 and P3 positions are favorable for achieving high in vitro M<sup>Pro</sup> inhibition potency, the P3 position is tolerable toward unnatural amino acids with two alkyl substituents on the \u03b1-carbon, and the inhibition potency is sensitive toward the N-terminal protection group. X-ray crystal structures of M<sup>Pro</sup> bound with 16 inhibitors were determined. In all structures, the M<sup>Pro</sup> active site cysteine interacts covalently with the aldehyde warhead of the bound inhibitor to form a hemithioacetal that takes an S configuration. For all inhibitors, election density around the N-terminal protection group is weak indicating possible flexible binding of this group to M<sup>Pro</sup>. In M<sup>Pro</sup>, large structural variations were observed on residues N142 and Q189. Unlike their high in vitro enzymatic inhibition potency, most inhibitors showed low potency to inhibit M<sup>Pro</sup> that was transiently expressed in 293T cells. Inhibitors that showed high potency to inhibit M<sup>Pro</sup> transiently expressed in 293T cells all contain O-tert-butyl-threonine at the P3 position. These inhibitors also exhibited relatively low cytotoxicity and high antiviral potency. Overall, our current and previous studies indicate that O-tert-butyl-threonine at the P3 site is a key component to achieve high cellular and antiviral potency for tripeptidyl aldehyde inhibitors of M<sup>Pro</sup>.",

    "abstract": "Somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) play versatile roles in inhibiting the secretion of multiple hormones such as growth hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone, and thus are considered as targets for treating multiple tumors. Despite great progress made in therapeutic development against this diverse receptor family, drugs that target SSTRs still show limited efficacy with preferential binding affinity and conspicuous side-effects. Here, we report five structures of SSTR2 and SSTR4 in different states, including two crystal structures of SSTR2 in complex with a selective peptide antagonist and a non-peptide agonist, respectively, a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of G<sub>i1</sub>-bound SSTR2 in the presence of the endogenous ligand SST-14, as well as two cryo-EM structures of G<sub>i1</sub>-bound SSTR4 in complex with SST-14 and a small-molecule agonist J-2156, respectively. By comparison of the SSTR structures in different states, molecular mechanisms of agonism and antagonism were illustrated. Together with computational and functional analyses, the key determinants responsible for ligand recognition and selectivity of different SSTR subtypes and multiform binding modes of peptide and non-peptide ligands were identified. Insights gained in this study will help uncover ligand selectivity of various SSTRs and accelerate the development of new molecules with better efficacy by targeting SSTRs.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial preproteins synthesized in cytosol are imported into mitochondria by a multisubunit translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex. Functioned as the receptor, the TOM complex components, Tom 20, Tom22, and Tom70, recognize the presequence and further guide the protein translocation. Their deficiency has been linked with neurodegenerative diseases and cardiac pathology. Although several structures of the TOM complex have been reported by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), how Tom22 and Tom20 function as TOM receptors remains elusive. Here we determined the structure of TOM core complex at 2.53 \u00c5 and captured the structure of the TOM complex containing Tom22 and Tom20 cytosolic domains at 3.74 \u00c5. Structural analysis indicates that Tom20 and Tom22 share a similar three-helix bundle structural feature in the cytosolic domain. Further structure-guided biochemical analysis reveals that the Tom22 cytosolic domain is responsible for binding to the presequence, and the helix H1 is critical for this binding. Altogether, our results provide insights into the functional mechanism of the TOM complex recognizing and transferring preproteins across the mitochondrial membrane.",

    "abstract": "Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are tetrameric ligand-gated ion channels that open their pores in response to binding of the agonist glutamate<sup>1-3</sup>. An ionic current through a single iGluR channel shows up to four discrete conductance levels (O1-O4)<sup>4-6</sup>. Higher conductance levels have been associated with an increased number of agonist molecules bound to four individual ligand-binding domains (LBDs)<sup>6-10</sup>. Here we determine structures of a synaptic complex of AMPA-subtype iGluR and the auxiliary subunit \u03b32 in non-desensitizing conditions with various occupancy of the LBDs by glutamate. We show that glutamate binds to LBDs of subunits B and D only after it is already bound to at least the same number of LBDs that belong to subunits A and C. Our structures combined with single-channel recordings, molecular dynamics simulations and machine-learning analysis suggest that channel opening requires agonist binding to at least two LBDs. Conversely, agonist binding to all four LBDs does not guarantee maximal channel conductance and favours subconductance states O1 and O2, with O3 and O4 being rare and not captured structurally. The lack of subunit independence and low efficiency coupling of glutamate binding to channel opening underlie the gating of synaptic complexes to submaximal conductance levels, which provide a potential for upregulation of synaptic activity.",

    "abstract": "Recognition of promoters in bacterial RNA polymerases (RNAPs) is controlled by sigma subunits. The key sequence motif recognized by the sigma, the -10 promoter element, is located in the non-template strand of the double-stranded DNA molecule ~10 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site. Here, we explain the mechanism by which the phage AR9 non-virion RNAP (nvRNAP), a bacterial RNAP homolog, recognizes the -10 element of its deoxyuridine-containing promoter in the template strand. The AR9 sigma-like subunit, the nvRNAP enzyme core, and the template strand together form two nucleotide base-accepting pockets whose shapes dictate the requirement for the conserved deoxyuridines. A single amino acid substitution in the AR9 sigma-like subunit allows one of these pockets to accept a thymine thus expanding the promoter consensus. Our work demonstrates the extent to which viruses can evolve host-derived multisubunit enzymes to make transcription of their own genes independent of the host.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of the first eukaryotic cell is preceded by evolutionary events, which are still highly debatable. Clues of the exact sequence of events are beginning to emerge. Recent metagenomics analyses has uncovered the Asgard super-phylum as the closest yet known archaea host of eukaryotes. Some of these have been tested and confirmed experimentally. However, the bulk of eukaryotic signature proteins predicted to be encoded by the Asgard super-phylum have not been studied, and their true functions, at least in the context of a eukaryotic cell, are still elusive. For example, there are several different variants of the profilin within each Asgardian Achaea, and there are some conflicting results of their actual roles. Here, the 3D structure of profilin from Thorarchaeota is determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and shows that this profilin has a eukaryotic-like profilin with a rigid core and an extended N-terminus previously implicated in polyproline binding. In addition, it is also shown that Thorarchaeota Profilin co-localizes with eukaryotic actin in cultured HeLa cells. This finding reaffirms the notion that Asgardian encoded proteins possess eukaryotic-like characteristics and strengthen the likely existence of a complex cytoskeleton already in a last eukaryotic common ancestor.",

    "abstract": "Human angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) has two isoforms, somatic ACE (sACE) and testis ACE (tACE). The functions of sACE are widespread, with its involvement in blood pressure regulation most extensively studied. sACE is composed of an N-domain (nACE) and a C-domain (cACE), both catalytically active but have significant structural differences, resulting in different substrate specificities. Even though ACE inhibitors are used clinically, they need much improvement because of serious side effects seen in patients (~\u200925-30%) with long-term treatment due to nonselective inhibition of nACE and cACE. Investigation into the distinguishing structural features of each domain is therefore of vital importance for the development of domain-specific inhibitors with minimal side effects. Here, we report kinetic data and high-resolution crystal structures of both nACE (1.75\u2009\u00c5) and cACE (1.85\u2009\u00c5) in complex with fosinoprilat, a clinically used inhibitor. These structures allowed detailed analysis of the molecular features conferring domain selectivity by fosinoprilat. Particularly, altered hydrophobic interactions were observed to be a contributing factor. These experimental data contribute to improved understanding of the structural features that dictate ACE inhibitor domain selectivity, allowing further progress towards designing novel 2nd-generation domain-specific potent ACE inhibitors suitable for clinical administration, with a variety of potential future therapeutic benefits.

    "abstract": "A previous bioinformatic analysis predicted that the <i>ysgA</i> open reading frame of <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> encodes an RNA methyltransferase of the SPOUT superfamily. Here we show that YsgA is the 2'-<i>O</i>-methyltransferase that targets position G2553 (<i>Escherichia coli</i> numbering) of the A-loop of 23S rRNA. This was shown by a combination of biochemical and mass spectrometry approaches using both rRNA extracted from <i>B. subtilis</i> wild-type or <i>\u0394ysgA</i> cells and in vitro synthesized rRNA. When the target G2553 is mutated, YsgA is able to methylate the ribose of adenosine. However, it cannot methylate cytidine nor uridine. The enzyme modifies free 23S rRNA but not the fully assembled ribosome nor the 50S subunit, suggesting that the modification occurs early during ribosome biogenesis. Nevertheless, ribosome subunits assembly is unaffected in a <i>B. subtilis \u0394ysgA</i> mutant strain. The crystal structure of the recombinant YsgA protein, combined with mutagenesis data, outlined in this article highlights a typical SPOUT fold preceded by an L7Ae/L30 (eL8/eL30 in a new nomenclature) amino-terminal domain.",

Here, wide SARS-CoV-2 immunoprofiling in Wuhan COVID-19 convalescents combining serological, cellular, and monoclonal antibody explorations revealed humoral immunity coordination. Detailed characterization of a hundred SARS-CoV-2 spike memory B-cell monoclonal antibodies uncovered diversity in their repertoire and antiviral functions. The latter were influenced by the targeted spike region with strong Fc-dependent effectors to the S2 subunit and potent neutralizers to the receptor-binding domain. Amongst those, Cv2.1169 and Cv2.3194 antibodies cross-neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including Omicron BA.1 and BA.2. Cv2.1169, isolated from a mucosa-derived IgA memory B cell demonstrated potency boost as IgA dimers and therapeutic efficacy as IgG antibodies in animal models. Structural data provided mechanistic clues to Cv2.1169 potency and breadth. Thus, potent broadly neutralizing IgA antibodies elicited in mucosal tissues can stem SARS-CoV-2 infection, and Cv2.1169 and Cv2.3194 are prime candidates for COVID-19 prevention and treatment.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of multidrug resistance in Acinetobacter spp. increases the risk of our best antibiotics losing their efficacy. From a clinical perspective, the carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D \u03b2-lactamase subfamily present in Acinetobacter spp. is particularly concerning because of its ability to confer resistance to carbapenems. The kinetic profiles of class D \u03b2-lactamases exhibit variability in carbapenem hydrolysis, suggesting functional differences. To better understand the structure-function relationship between the carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D \u03b2-lactamase OXA-24/40 found in Acinetobacter baumannii and carbapenem substrates, we analyzed steady-state kinetics with the carbapenem antibiotics meropenem and ertapenem and determined the structures of complexes of OXA-24/40 bound to imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem, as well as the expanded-spectrum cephalosporin cefotaxime, using X-ray crystallography. We show that OXA-24/40 exhibits a preference for ertapenem compared with meropenem, imipenem, and doripenem, with an increase in catalytic efficiency of up to fourfold. We suggest that superposition of the nine OXA-24/40 complexes will better inform future inhibitor design efforts by providing insight into the complicated and varying ways in which carbapenems are selected and bound by class D \u03b2-lactamases.",

    "abstract": "Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are important epigenetic regulators involved in many diseases, especially cancer. Five HDAC inhibitors have been approved for anticancer therapy and many are in clinical trials. Among the 11 zinc-dependent HDACs, HDAC10 has received relatively little attention by drug discovery campaigns, despite its involvement, e.\u2009g., in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma. This is due in part to a lack of robust enzymatic conversion assays. In contrast to the protein lysine deacetylase and deacylase activity of most other HDAC subtypes, it has recently been shown that HDAC10 has strong preferences for deacetylation of oligoamine substrates like acetyl-putrescine or -spermidine. Hence, it is also termed a polyamine deacetylase (PDAC). Here, we present the first fluorescent enzymatic conversion assay for HDAC10 using an aminocoumarin-labelled acetyl-spermidine derivative to measure its PDAC activity, which is suitable for high-throughput screening. Using this assay, we identified potent inhibitors of HDAC10-mediated spermidine deacetylation in\u2005vitro. Based on the oligoamine preference of HDAC10, we also designed inhibitors with a basic moiety in appropriate distance to the zinc binding hydroxamate that showed potent inhibition of HDAC10 with high selectivity, and we solved a HDAC10-inhibitor structure using X-ray crystallography. We could demonstrate selective cellular target engagement for HDAC10 but a lysosomal phenotype in neuroblastoma cells that was previously associated with HDAC10 inhibition was not observed. Thus, we have developed new chemical probes for HDAC10 that allow further clarification of the biological role of this enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Flavin coenzymes are universally found in biological redox reactions. DNA photolyases, with their flavin chromophore (FAD), utilize blue light for DNA repair and photoreduction. The latter process involves two single-electron transfers to FAD with an intermittent protonation step to prime the enzyme active for DNA repair. Here we use time-resolved serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography to describe how light-driven electron transfers trigger subsequent nanosecond-to-microsecond entanglement between FAD and its Asn/Arg-Asp redox sensor triad. We found that this key feature within the photolyase-cryptochrome family regulates FAD re-hybridization and protonation. After first electron transfer, the FAD<sup>\u2022-</sup> isoalloxazine ring twists strongly when the arginine closes in to stabilize the negative charge. Subsequent breakage of the arginine-aspartate salt bridge allows proton transfer from arginine to FAD<sup>\u2022-</sup>. Our molecular videos demonstrate how the protein environment of redox cofactors organizes multiple electron/proton transfer events in an ordered fashion, which could be applicable to other redox systems such as photosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Among the functions exerted by eukaryotic lactate dehydrogenases, it is of importance the generation of lactate in muscles subjected to fatigue or to limited oxygen availability, with both these conditions triggering a decrease of cellular pH. However, the mutual dependence between lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) catalytic action and lactic acidosis is far from being fully understood. Here we show that the tetrameric LDH from rabbit skeletal muscle undergoes allosteric transitions as a function of pH, i.e. the enzyme obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics at neutral or slightly alkaline pH values, and features sigmoidal kinetics at pH 6.5 or lower. Remarkably, we also report that a significant dissociation of tetrameric rabbit LDH occurs under acidic conditions, with pyruvate/NAD<sup>+</sup> or citrate counteracting this effect. Moreover, citrate strongly activates rabbit LDH, inducing the enzyme to feature Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Further, using primary rabbit skeletal muscle cells we tested the generation of lactate as a function of pH, and we detected a parallel decrease of cytosolic pH and secretion of lactate. Overall, our observations indicate that lactic acidosis is antagonized by LDH dissociation, the occurrence of which is regulated by citrate and by allosteric transitions of the enzyme induced by pyruvate.",

    "abstract": "The metal-dependent M17 aminopeptidases are conserved throughout all kingdoms of life. This large enzyme family is characterized by a conserved binuclear metal center and a distinctive homohexameric arrangement. Recently, we showed that hexamer formation in Plasmodium M17 aminopeptidases was controlled by the metal ion environment, although the functional necessity for hexamer formation is still unclear. To further understand the mechanistic role of the hexameric assembly, here we undertook an investigation of the structure and dynamics of the M17 aminopeptidase from Plasmodium falciparum, PfA-M17. We describe a novel structure of PfA-M17, which shows that the active sites of each trimer are linked by a dynamic loop, and loop movement is coupled with a drastic rearrangement of the binuclear metal center and substrate-binding pocket, rendering the protein inactive. Molecular dynamics simulations and biochemical analyses of PfA-M17 variants demonstrated that this rearrangement is inherent to PfA-M17, and that the transition between the active and inactive states is metal dependent and part of a dynamic regulatory mechanism. Key to the mechanism is a remodeling of the binuclear metal center, which occurs in response to a signal from the neighboring active site and serves to moderate the rate of proteolysis under different environmental conditions. In conclusion, this work identifies a precise mechanism by which oligomerization contributes to PfA-M17 function. Furthermore, it describes a novel role for metal cofactors in the regulation of enzymes, with implications for the wide range of metalloenzymes that operate via a two-metal ion catalytic center, including DNA processing enzymes and metalloproteases.",

    "abstract": "Human noroviruses (huNoVs) cause epidemic acute gastroenteritis using histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) as host receptors or attachment factors to initiate an infection. While most huNoVs have been shown to bind HBGAs, some known clinical isolates, such as GI.3 DSV and VA115, do not recognize any HBGAs and thus the molecular mechanism behind their infections remains elusive. In this study, we provided both phenotypic and structural evidence to show that huNoV DSV and VA115 recognize a group of glycans with terminal galactoses as ligands. First, through glycan array we found that both DSV and VA115 protruding (P) domain proteins bound two oligosaccharides that share common terminal galactoses. Then, by determination of the crystal structures of DSV/VA115 P proteins in complex with Gal\u03b11-3Gal\u03b21-4Glc and/or NA2 <i>N</i>-Glycan, respectively, we showed that the terminal galactose is the main saccharide recognized by the two viral proteins. Our data demonstrated that GI huNoVs can interact with non-HBGA glycans through their conserved galactose binding site, shedding light on the mechanism of huNoV adaptation through recognizing new glycan receptors to facilitate their widespread nature in human population. These findings are also of significance in strategy development for huNoV control and prevention, as well as development of antiviral drugs. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Human noroviruses (huNoVs) are the most important viral pathogens causing epidemic acute gastroenteritis worldwide. Previous studies indicated that histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) are critical host-susceptibility factors affecting huNoV host susceptibility, host range, and probably prevalence. However, certain huNoVs, such as GI.3 DSV and VA115, do not recognize any HBGAs. This implies that other unknown host factors might exist and the molecular mechanism underlying their host receptor recognition or attachment remains elusive. In this study, we found that purified capsid protruding domain proteins from two GI.3 huNoVs specifically bind two glycans that contain a common terminal galactose. We solved the crystal structures of the complexes at atomic resolution and validated the vital amino acids involved in glycan recognition. Our findings elucidate the mechanism of GI.3 huNoV-non-HBGA glycan interaction, which explains why GI.3 virus strains could not bind human HBGAs, paving a way to the prevention and treatment of huNoV-associated diseases.",

    "abstract": "Rhesus monkeys have evolved MHC-encoded class I allomorphs such as Mamu-B\u2217098 that are capable of binding N-myristoylated short lipopeptides rather than conventional long peptides; however, it remains unknown whether such antigen-binding molecules exist in other species, including humans. We herein demonstrate that human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A\u221724:02 and HLA-C\u221714:02 proteins, which are known to bind conventional long peptides, also have the potential to bind N-myristoylated short lipopeptides. These HLA class I molecules shared a serine at position 9 (Ser9) with Mamu-B\u2217098, in contrast to most MHC class I molecules that harbor a larger amino acid residue, such as tyrosine, at this position. High resolution X-ray crystallographic analyses of lipopeptide-bound HLA-A\u221724:02 and HLA-C\u221714:02 complexes indicated that Ser9 was at the bottom of the B pocket with its small hydroxymethyl side chain directed away from the B-pocket cavity, thereby contributing to the formation of a deep hydrophobic cavity suitable for accommodating the long-chain fatty acid moiety of lipopeptide ligands. Upon peptide binding, however, we found the hydrogen-bond network involving Ser9 was reorganized, and the remodeled B pocket was able to capture the second amino acid residue (P2) of peptide ligands. Apart from the B pocket, virtually no marked alterations were observed for the A and F pockets upon peptide and lipopeptide binding. Thus, we concluded that the structural flexibility of the large B pocket of HLA-A\u22172402 and HLA-C\u22171402 primarily accounted for their previously unrecognized capacity to bind such chemically distinct ligands as conventional peptides and N-myristoylated lipopeptides.",

    "abstract": "The programmable synthesis of rationally engineered crystal architectures for the precise arrangement of molecular species is a foundational goal in nanotechnology, and DNA has become one of the most prominent molecules for the construction of these materials. In particular, branched DNA junctions have been used as the central building block for the assembly of 3D lattices. Here, crystallography is used to probe the effect of all 36 immobile Holliday junction sequences on self-assembling DNA crystals. Contrary to the established paradigm in the field, most junctions yield crystals, with some enhancing the resolution or resulting in unique crystal symmetries. Unexpectedly, even the sequence adjacent to the junction has a significant effect on the crystal assemblies. Six of the immobile junction sequences are completely resistant to crystallization and thus deemed \"fatal,\" and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that these junctions invariably lack two discrete ion binding sites that are pivotal for crystal formation. The structures and dynamics detailed here could be used to inform future designs of both crystals and DNA nanostructures more broadly, and have potential implications for the molecular engineering of applied nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, and catalysis within the crystalline context.",

    "abstract": "The interplay between the primary and secondary coordination spheres in biological metal sites plays an essential role in controlling their properties. Some of the clearest examples of this are from copper sites in blue and purple copper proteins. Many such proteins contain methionine (Met) in the primary coordination sphere as a weakly bound ligand to Cu. While the effects of replacing the coordinated Met are understood, less so is the importance of its second-sphere interactions. In this combined informatics and experimental study, we first present a bioinformatics investigation of the second-sphere environments in biological Met-Cu motifs. The most common interaction is between the Met-CH<sub>3</sub> and the \u03c0-face of a phenylalanine (Phe) (81% of surveyed structures), tyrosine (Tyr) (11%), and tryptophan (Trp) (8%). In most cases, the Met-CH<sub>3</sub> also forms a contact with a \u03c0-face of one of a Cu-ligating histidine-imidazole. Such interactions are widely distributed in different Cu proteins. Second, to explore the impact of the second-sphere interactions of Met, a series of artificial <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> azurin proteins were produced where the native Phe15 was replaced with Tyr or Trp. The proteins were characterized using optical and magnetic resonance spectroscopies, X-ray diffraction, electrochemistry, and an investigation of the time-resolved electron-transfer kinetics of photosensitizer-modified proteins. The influence of the Cu-Met-Aro interaction on azurin's physical properties is subtle, and the hallmarks of the azurin blue copper site are maintained. In the Phe15Trp variant, the mutation to Phe15 induces changes in Cu properties that are comparable to replacement of the weak Met ligand. The broader impacts of these widely distributed interactions are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Potent and durable vaccine responses will be required for control of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). RTS,S/AS01 is the first, and to date, the only vaccine that has demonstrated significant reduction of clinical and severe malaria in endemic cohorts in Phase 3 trials. Although the vaccine is protective, efficacy declines over time with kinetics paralleling the decline in antibody responses to the Pf circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP). Although most attention has focused on antibodies to repeat motifs on PfCSP, antibodies to other regions may play a role in protection. Here, we expressed and characterized seven monoclonal antibodies to the C-terminal domain of CSP (ctCSP) from volunteers immunized with RTS,S/AS01. Competition and crystal structure studies indicated that the antibodies target two different sites on opposite faces of ctCSP. One site contains a polymorphic region (denoted \u03b1-ctCSP) and has been previously characterized, whereas the second is a previously undescribed site on the conserved \u03b2-sheet face of the ctCSP (denoted \u03b2-ctCSP). Antibodies to the \u03b2-ctCSP site exhibited broad reactivity with a diverse panel of ctCSP peptides whose sequences were derived from field isolates of P. falciparum whereas antibodies to the \u03b1-ctCSP site showed very limited cross reactivity. Importantly, an antibody to the \u03b2-site demonstrated inhibition activity against malaria infection in a murine model. This study identifies a previously unidentified conserved epitope on CSP that could be targeted by prophylactic antibodies and exploited in structure-based vaccine design.",

    "abstract": "Structures of two globular proteins were determined ab initio using microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) data that were collected on a direct electron detector in counting mode. Microcrystals were identified using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and thinned with a focused ion beam (FIB) to produce crystalline lamellae of ideal thickness. Continuous-rotation data were collected using an ultra-low exposure rate to enable electron counting in diffraction. For the first sample, triclinic lysozyme extending to a resolution of 0.87\u2009\u00c5, an ideal helical fragment of only three alanine residues provided initial phases. These phases were improved using density modification, allowing the entire atomic structure to be built automatically. A similar approach was successful on a second macromolecular sample, proteinase K, which is much larger and diffracted to a resolution of 1.5\u2009\u00c5. These results demonstrate that macromolecules can be determined to sub-\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m resolution by MicroED and that ab initio phasing can be successfully applied to counting data.",

    "abstract": "Protein synthesis in crop plants contributes to the balance of food and fuel on our planet, which influences human metabolic activity and lifespan. Protein synthesis can be regulated with respect to changing environmental cues via the deposition of chemical modifications into rRNA. Here, we present the structure of a plant ribosome from tomato and a quantitative mass spectrometry analysis of its rRNAs. The study reveals fine features of the ribosomal proteins and 71 plant-specific rRNA modifications, and it re-annotates 30 rRNA residues in the available sequence. At the protein level, isoAsp is found in position 137 of uS11, and a zinc finger previously believed to be universal is missing from eL34, suggesting a lower effect of zinc deficiency on protein synthesis in plants. At the rRNA level, the plant ribosome differs markedly from its human counterpart with respect to the spatial distribution of modifications. Thus, it represents an additional layer of gene expression regulation, highlighting the molecular signature of a plant ribosome. The results provide a reference model of a plant ribosome for structural studies and an accurate marker for molecular ecology.",

    "abstract": "Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) are deadly zoonotic Henipaviruses (HNVs) responsible for recurrent outbreaks in humans and domestic species of highly fatal (50 to 95%) disease. A HeV variant (HeV-g2) of unprecedented genetic divergence has been identified in two fatally diseased horses, and in two flying fox species in regions of Australia not previously considered at risk for HeV spillover. Given the HeV-g2 divergence from HeV while retaining equivalent pathogenicity and spillover potential, understanding receptor usage and antigenic properties is urgently required to guide One Health biosecurity. Here, we show that the HeV-g2 G glycoprotein shares a conserved receptor tropism with prototypic HeV and that a panel of monoclonal antibodies recognizing the G and F glycoproteins potently neutralizes HeV-g2\u2013 and HeV G/F\u2013mediated entry into cells. We determined a crystal structure of the Fab fragment of the hAH1.3 antibody bound to the HeV G head domain, revealing an antigenic site associated with potent cross-neutralization of both HeV-g2 and HeV. Structure-guided formulation of a tetravalent monoclonal antibody (mAb) mixture, targeting four distinct G head antigenic sites, results in potent neutralization of HeV and HeV-g2 and delineates a path forward for implementing multivalent mAb combinations for postexposure treatment of HNV infections.",

    "abstract": "Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is an important marine anti-stress compound, with key roles in global nutrient cycling, chemotaxis and, potentially, climate regulation. Recently, diverse marine Actinobacteria, \u03b1- and \u03b3-proteobacteria were shown to initiate DMSP synthesis via the methionine (Met) S-methyltransferase enzyme (MmtN), generating S-methyl-Met (SMM). Here we characterize a roseobacterial MmtN, providing structural and mechanistic insights into this DMSP synthesis enzyme. We propose that MmtN uses the proximity and desolvation mechanism for Met S-methylation with two adjacent MmtN monomers comprising the Met binding site. We also identify diverse functional MmtN enzymes in potentially symbiotic archaeal Candidatus Woesearchaeota and Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) bacteria, and the animalcule Adineta steineri, not anticipated to produce SMM and/or DMSP. These diverse MmtN enzymes, alongside the larger plant MMT enzyme with an N-terminus homologous to MmtN, likely utilize the same proximity and desolvation mechanism. This study provides important insights into the catalytic mechanism of SMM and/or DMSP production, and proposes roles for these compounds in secondary metabolite production, and SMM cycling in diverse organisms and environments.",

    "abstract": "Deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) triphosphohydrolases (dNTPases) are important enzymes that may perform multiple functions in the cell, including regulating the dNTP pools and contributing to innate immunity against viruses. Among the homologs that are best studied are human sterile alpha motif and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), a tetrameric dNTPase, and the hexameric Escherichia coli dGTPase; however, it is unclear whether these are representative of all dNTPases given their wide distribution throughout life. Here, we investigated a hexameric homolog from the marine bacterium Leeuwenhoekiella blandensis, revealing that it is a dGTPase that is subject to allosteric activation by dATP, specifically. Allosteric regulation mediated solely by dATP represents a novel regulatory feature among dNTPases that may facilitate maintenance of cellular dNTP pools in L. blandensis. We present high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structures (1.80-2.26 \u00c5) in catalytically important conformations as well as cryo-EM structures (2.1-2.7 \u00c5) of the enzyme bound to dGTP and dATP ligands. The structures, the highest resolution cryo-EM structures of any SAMHD1-like dNTPase to date, reveal an intact metal-binding site with the dGTP substrate coordinated to three metal ions. These structural and biochemical data yield insights into the catalytic mechanism and support a conserved catalytic mechanism for the tetrameric and hexameric dNTPase homologs. We conclude that the allosteric activation by dATP appears to rely on structural connectivity between the allosteric and active sites, as opposed to the changes in oligomeric state upon ligand binding used by SAMHD1.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation of initially stably structured proteins is involved in more than 20 human amyloid diseases. Despite intense research, however, how this class of proteins assembles into amyloid fibrils remains poorly understood, principally because of the complex effects of amino acid substitutions on protein stability, solubility, and aggregation propensity. We address this question using \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22m) as a model system, focusing on D76N-\u03b22m that is involved in hereditary amyloidosis. This amino acid substitution causes the aggregation-resilient wild-type protein to become highly aggregation prone in vitro, although the mechanism by which this occurs remained elusive. Here, we identify the residues key to protecting \u03b22m from aggregation by coupling aggregation with antibiotic resistance in E. coli using a tripartite \u03b2-lactamase assay (TPBLA). By performing saturation mutagenesis at three different sites (D53X-, D76X-, and D98X-\u03b22m) we show that residue 76 has a unique ability to drive \u03b22m aggregation in vivo and in vitro. Using a randomly mutated D76N-\u03b22m variant library, we show that all of the mutations found to improve protein behavior involve residues in a single aggregation-prone region (APR) (residues 60 to 66). Surprisingly, no correlation was found between protein stability and protein aggregation rate or yield, with several mutations in the APR decreasing aggregation without affecting stability. Together, the results demonstrate the power of the TPBLA to develop proteins that are resilient to aggregation and suggest a model for D76N-\u03b22m aggregation involving the formation of long-range couplings between the APR and Asn76 in a nonnative state.",

    "abstract": "The metabolic enzyme, enolase, plays a crucial role in the cytoplasm where it maintains cellular energy production within the process of glycolysis. The main role of enolase in glycolysis is to convert 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate; however, enolase can fulfill roles that deviate from this function. In pathogenic bacteria and fungi, enolase is also located on the cell surface where it functions as a virulence factor. Surface-expressed enolase is a receptor for human plasma proteins, including plasminogen, and this interaction facilitates nutrient acquisition and tissue invasion. A novel approach to developing antifungal drugs is to inhibit the formation of this complex. To better understand the structure of enolase and the interactions that may govern complex formation, we have solved the first X-ray crystal structure of enolase from Aspergillus fumigatus (2.0\u00a0\u00c5) and have shown that it preferentially adopts a dimeric quaternary structure using native mass spectrometry. Two additional X-ray crystal structures of A. fumigatus enolase bound to the endogenous substrate 2-phosphoglycerate and product phosphoenolpyruvate were determined and kinetic characterization was carried out to better understand the details of its canonical function. From these data, we have produced a model of the A. fumigatus enolase and human plasminogen complex to provide structural insights into the mechanisms of virulence and aid future development of small molecules or peptidomimetics for antifungal drug design.",

    "abstract": "Plant GDP-D-mannose pyrophosphorylase (GMPase) catalyzes a committed step in ascorbic acid biosynthesis pathway. <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> VTC1 is the first genetically characterized plant GMPase and has unique properties when compared with bacterial and animal homologs. Here we present the crystal structures of VTC1 in the unliganded and product-bound states at resolutions of 2.8 and 3.0 \u00c5, respectively. VTC1 dimerizes in a same way like other known GMPases, but dodecamerizes in a previously unobserved arrangement. The interactions to GDP-D-mannose and inorganic pyrophosphate are revealed by the product-bound VTC1 structure. An <i>in vitro</i> GMPase activity assay confirms the regulatory role of the C-terminal left-handed \u03b2-helix domain, and structural analyses suggest the models of VTC1 hetero-complex with its interacting proteins. The structural information advances our insights into the different mechanisms involved in VTC1 regulation.",

Two DPR proteins, poly-PR and poly-GR, repress cellular translation but the molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that poly-PR and poly-GR of \u226520 repeats inhibit the ribosome's peptidyl-transferase activity at nanomolar concentrations, comparable to specific translation inhibitors. High-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reveals that poly-PR and poly-GR block the polypeptide tunnel of the ribosome, extending into the peptidyl-transferase center (PTC). Consistent with these findings, the macrolide erythromycin, which binds in the tunnel, competes with poly-PR and restores peptidyl-transferase activity. Our results demonstrate that strong and specific binding of poly-PR and poly-GR in the ribosomal tunnel blocks translation, revealing the structural basis of their toxicity in C9ORF72-ALS/FTD.",

    "abstract": "The human PDZome represents one of the largest globular domain families in the human proteome, with 266 instances. These globular domains typically interact with C-terminal peptide motifs found in thousands of human proteins. Despite previous efforts, not all PDZ domains have experimentally solved structures and most of their complexes remain to be solved. Here, a simple and cost-effective strategy is proposed for the crystallization of PDZ domains and their complexes. A human annexin A2 fusion tag was used as a crystallization chaperone and the structures of nine PDZ domains were solved, including five domains that had not yet been solved. Finally, these novel experimental structures were compared with AlphaFold predictions and it is speculated how predictions and experimental methods could cooperate in order to investigate the structural landscapes of entire domain families and interactomes.",

Preliminary screening of novel antifolates revealed related chemotypes that showed high levels of inhibitory potency against Escherichia coli chromosomal DHFR (EcDHFR), DfrA1, and DfrA5. Kinetics and biophysical analysis, coupled with crystal structures of trimethoprim bound to EcDHFR, DfrA1 and DfrA5, and two propargyl-linked antifolates (PLA) complexed with EcDHFR, DfrA1 and DfrA5, were determined to define structural features of the substrate binding pocket and guide synthesis of pan-DHFR inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "ATP7A and ATP7B, two homologous copper-transporting P1B-type ATPases, play crucial roles in cellular copper homeostasis, and mutations cause Menkes and Wilson diseases, respectively. ATP7A/B contains a P-type ATPase core consisting of a membrane transport domain and three cytoplasmic domains, the A, P, and N domains, and a unique amino terminus comprising six consecutive metal-binding domains. Here, we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of frog ATP7B in a copper-free state. Interacting with both the A and P domains, the metal-binding domains are poised to exert copper-dependent regulation of ATP hydrolysis coupled to transmembrane copper transport. A ring of negatively charged residues lines the cytoplasmic copper entrance that is presumably gated by a conserved basic residue sitting at the center. Within the membrane, a network of copper-coordinating ligands delineates a stepwise copper transport pathway. This work provides the first glimpse into the structure and function of ATP7 proteins and facilitates understanding of disease mechanisms and development of rational therapies.",

Here, we dissected the molecular mechanism of the inhibitory function of the \u223c720-kDa h\u03b12M tetramer through eight cryo\u2013electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of complexes from human plasma. In the native complex, the h\u03b12M subunits are organized in two flexible modules in expanded conformation, which enclose a highly porous cavity in which the proteolytic activity of circulating plasma proteins is tested. Cleavage of bait regions exposed inside the cavity triggers rearrangement to a compact conformation, which closes openings and entraps the prey proteinase. After the expanded-to-compact transition, which occurs independently in the four subunits, the reactive thioester bond triggers covalent linking of the proteinase, and the receptor-binding domain is exposed on the tetramer surface for receptor-mediated clearance from circulation. These results depict the molecular mechanism of a unique suicidal inhibitory trap.",

Many gram-positive bacteria use a type 1 MetRS (MetRS1), which is considered a promising antimicrobial drug target due to its low sequence identity with human cytosolic MetRS (HcMetRS, which belongs to MetRS2). Here, we report crystal structures of a representative MetRS1 from Staphylococcus aureus (SaMetRS) in its apo and substrate-binding forms. The connecting peptide (CP) domain of SaMetRS differs from HcMetRS in structural organization and dynamic movement. We screened 1049 chemical fragments against SaMetRS preincubated with or without substrate ATP, and ten hits were identified. Four cocrystal structures revealed that the fragments bound to either the L-Met binding site or an auxiliary pocket near the tRNA CCA end binding site of SaMetRS. Interestingly, fragment binding was enhanced by ATP in most cases, suggesting a potential ATP-assisted ligand binding mechanism in MetRS1. Moreover, co-binding with ATP was also observed in our cocrystal structure of SaMetRS with a class of newly reported inhibitors that simultaneously occupied the auxiliary pocket, tRNA site and L-Met site. Our findings will inspire the development of new MetRS1 inhibitors for fighting microbial infections.",

    "abstract": "A key role of chromatin kinases is to phosphorylate histone tails during mitosis to spatiotemporally regulate cell division. Vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1) is a serine-threonine kinase that phosphorylates histone H3 threonine 3 (H3T3) along with other chromatin-based targets. While structural studies have defined how several classes of histone-modifying enzymes bind to and function on nucleosomes, the mechanism of chromatin engagement by kinases is largely unclear. Here, we paired cryo-electron microscopy with biochemical and cellular assays to demonstrate that VRK1 interacts with both linker DNA and the nucleosome acidic patch to phosphorylate H3T3. Acidic patch binding by VRK1 is mediated by an arginine-rich flexible C-terminal tail. Homozygous missense and nonsense mutations of this acidic patch recognition motif in VRK1 are causative in rare adult-onset distal spinal muscular atrophy. We show that these VRK1 mutations interfere with nucleosome acidic patch binding, leading to mislocalization of VRK1 during mitosis, thus providing a potential new molecular mechanism for pathogenesis.",

Here we present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of rat TRPV2 in lipid nanodiscs activated by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) and propose a TRPV2-specific 2-ABP binding site at the interface of S5 of one monomer and the S4-S5 linker of the adjacent monomer. In silico docking and electrophysiological studies confirm the key role of His521 and Arg539 in 2-APB activation of TRPV2. Additionally, electrophysiological experiments show that the combination of 2-APB and cannabidiol has a synergetic effect on TRPV2 activation, and cryo-EM structures demonstrate that both drugs were able to bind simultaneously. Together, our cryo-EM structures represent multiple functional states of the channel, providing a native picture of TRPV2 activation by small molecules and a structural framework for the development of TRPV2-specific activators.",

    "abstract": "Bromodomains regulate chromatin remodeling and gene transcription through recognition of acetylated lysines on histones and other proteins. Bromodomain-containing protein TAF1, a subunit of general transcription factor TFIID, initiates preinitiation complex formation and cellular transcription. TAF1 serves as a cofactor for certain oncogenic transcription factors and is implicated in regulating the p53 tumor suppressor. Therefore, TAF1 is a potential target to develop small molecule therapeutics for diseases arising from dysregulated transcription, such as cancer. Here, we report the ATR kinase inhibitor AZD6738 (Ceralasertib) and analogues thereof as bona fide inhibitors of TAF1. Crystallographic and small-angle X-ray scattering studies established that newly identified and previously reported inhibitors stabilize distinct structural states of the TAF1 tandem bromodomain through \"open-closed\" transitions and dimerization. Combined with functional studies on p53 signaling in cancer cell lines, the data provide new insights into the feasibility and challenges of TAF1 inhibitors as chemical probes and therapeutics.",

Due to the accumulating cases of breakthrough infections, there are urgent needs for broad-spectrum antiviral medicines. Here, we designed and examined five new tetrapeptidomimetic anti-SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors targeting the 3C-Like protease (3CL<sup>Pro</sup>), which is highly conserved among coronaviruses and essential for viral replications. We significantly improved the efficacy of a ketoamide lead compound based on high-resolution co-crystal structures, all-atom simulations, and binding energy calculations. The inhibitors successfully engaged the catalytic dyad histidine residue (H41) of 3CLPro as designed, and they exhibited nanomolar inhibitory capacity as well as mitigated the viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 in cellular assays. As a widely applicable design principle, our results revealed that the potencies of 3CL<sup>Pro</sup>-specific drug candidates were determined by the interplay between 3CL<sup>Pro</sup> H41 residue and the peptidomimetic inhibitors.",

An important group of enzymes has been deprived of this analytical privilege: members of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) superfamily with catalytic WPD-loops lacking the indispensable general-acid/base within a tryptophan-proline-aspartate/glutamate context. Here, we provide the ligand/enzyme crystal complexes for one such PTP outlier: Arabidopsis thaliana Plant and Fungi Atypical Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1 (AtPFA-DSP1), herein unveiled as a regioselective and efficient phosphatase towards inositol pyrophosphate (PP-InsP) signaling molecules. Although the WPD loop is missing its canonical tripeptide motif, this structural element contributes to catalysis by assisting PP-InsP delivery into the catalytic pocket, for a choreographed exchange with phosphate reaction product. Subsequently, an intramolecular proton donation by PP-InsP substrate is posited to substitute functionally for the absent aspartate/glutamate general-acid. Overall, we expand mechanistic insight into adaptability of the conserved PTP structural elements.",

The F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>O</sub> motors oppose each other's action on a shared rotor subcomplex and are held stationary relative to each other by a peripheral stalk. Structures of resting mitochondrial ATP synthases revealed a left-handed curvature of the peripheral stalk even though rotation of the rotor, driven by either ATP hydrolysis in F<sub>1</sub> or proton translocation through F<sub>O</sub>, would apply a right-handed bending force to the stalk. We used cryoEM to image yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase under strain during ATP-hydrolysis-driven rotary catalysis, revealing a large deformation of the peripheral stalk. The structures show how the peripheral stalk opposes the bending force and suggests that during ATP synthesis\u00a0proton translocation causes accumulation of strain in the stalk, which relaxes by driving the relative rotation of the rotor through six sub-steps within F<sub>1</sub>, leading to catalysis.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that escape from immune neutralization are challenging vaccines and antibodies developed to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, it is important to establish therapeutics directed toward multiple or specific SARS-CoV-2 variants. The envelope spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is the key target of neutralizing antibodies (Abs). We selected a panel of nine nanobodies (Nbs) from dromedary camels immunized with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S, and engineered Nb fusions as humanized heavy chain Abs (hcAbs). Nbs and derived hcAbs bound with subnanomolar or picomolar affinities to the S and its RBD, and S-binding cross-competition clustered them in two different groups. Most of the hcAbs hindered RBD binding to its human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor, blocked cell entry of viruses pseudotyped with the S protein and neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell cultures. Four potent neutralizing hcAbs prevented the progression to lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection in hACE2-transgenic mice, demonstrating their therapeutic potential. Cryo-electron microscopy identified Nb binding epitopes in and out the receptor binding motif (RBM), and showed different ways to prevent virus binding to its cell entry receptor. The Nb binding modes were consistent with its recognition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD variants; mono and bispecific hcAbs efficiently bound all variants of concern except omicron, which emphasized the immune escape capacity of this latest variant.",

    "abstract": "Insulin analogs have been developed to treat diabetes with focus primarily on improving the time action profile without affecting ligand-receptor interaction or functional selectivity. As a result, inherent liabilities (e.g. hypoglycemia) of injectable insulin continue to limit the true therapeutic potential of related agents. Insulin dimers were synthesized to investigate whether partial agonism of the insulin receptor (IR) tyrosine kinase is achievable, and to explore the potential for tissue-selective systemic insulin pharmacology. The insulin dimers induced distinct IR conformational changes compared to native monomeric insulin and substrate phosphorylation assays demonstrated partial agonism. Structurally distinct dimers with differences in conjugation sites and linkers were prepared to deliver desirable IR partial agonist (IRPA). Systemic infusions of a B29-B29 dimer in vivo revealed sharp differences compared to native insulin. Suppression of hepatic glucose production and lipolysis were like that attained with regular insulin, albeit with a distinctly shallower dose-response. In contrast, there was highly attenuated stimulation of glucose uptake into muscle. Mechanistic studies indicated that IRPAs exploit tissue differences in receptor density and have additional distinctions pertaining to drug clearance and distribution. The hepato-adipose selective action of IRPAs is a potentially safer approach for treatment of diabetes.",

    "abstract": "The dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase DYRK2 has emerged as a critical regulator of cellular processes. We took a chemical biology approach to gain further insights into its function. We developed C17, a potent small-molecule DYRK2 inhibitor, through multiple rounds of structure-based optimization guided by several co-crystallized structures. C17 displayed an effect on DYRK2 at a single-digit nanomolar IC<sub>50</sub> and showed outstanding selectivity for the human kinome containing 467 other human kinases. Using C17 as a chemical probe, we further performed quantitative phosphoproteomic assays and identified several novel DYRK2 targets, including eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1). DYRK2 phosphorylated 4E-BP1 at multiple sites, and the combined treatment of C17 with AKT and MEK inhibitors showed synergistic 4E-BP1 phosphorylation suppression. The phosphorylation of STIM1 by DYRK2 substantially increased the interaction of STIM1 with the ORAI1 channel, and C17 impeded the store-operated calcium entry process. These studies collectively further expand our understanding of DYRK2 and provide a valuable tool to pinpoint its biological function.",

In the present study, we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of CI from Sus scrofa in six treatment conditions at a resolution of 2.4-3.5\u2009\u00c5, in which CI structures of each condition can be classified into two biochemical classes (active or deactive), with a notably higher proportion of active CI particles. These structures illuminate how hydrophobic ubiquinone-10 (Q10) with its long isoprenoid tail is bound and reduced in a narrow Q chamber comprising four different Q10-binding sites. Structural comparisons of active CI structures from our decylubiquinone-NADH and rotenone-NADH datasets reveal that Q10 reduction at site 1 is not coupled to proton pumping in the membrane arm, which might instead be coupled to Q10 oxidation at site 2. Our data overturn the widely accepted previous proposal about the coupling mechanism of CI.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is dominant in many countries worldwide. The high number of spike mutations is responsible for the broad immune evasion from existing vaccines and antibody drugs. To understand this, we first present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of ACE2-bound SARS-CoV-2 Omicron spike. Comparison to previous spike antibody structures explains how Omicron escapes these therapeutics. Secondly, we report structures of Omicron, Delta, and wild-type spikes bound to a patient-derived Fab antibody fragment (510A5), which provides direct evidence where antibody binding is greatly attenuated by the Omicron mutations, freeing spike to bind ACE2. Together with biochemical binding and 510A5 neutralization assays, our work establishes principles of binding required for neutralization and clearly illustrates how the mutations lead to antibody evasion yet retain strong ACE2 interactions. Structural information on spike with both bound and unbound antibodies collectively elucidates potential strategies for generation of therapeutic antibodies.",

The minimal set of allosteric events required for oscillatory nature is a bidirectional coupling between the coil-to-helix transition of the Ser<sup>431</sup>-dependent phospho-switch in the C-terminal domain of KaiC and adenosine 5'-diphosphate release from its N-terminal domain during adenosine triphosphatase cycle.

    "abstract": "Tousled-like kinases (TLKs) are nuclear serine-threonine kinases essential for genome maintenance and proper cell division in animals and plants. A major function of TLKs is to phosphorylate the histone chaperone proteins ASF1a and ASF1b to facilitate DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly, but how TLKs selectively target these critical substrates is unknown. Here, we show that TLK2 selectivity towards ASF1 substrates is achieved in two ways. First, the TLK2 catalytic domain recognizes consensus phosphorylation site motifs in the ASF1 C-terminal tail. Second, a short sequence at the TLK2 N-terminus docks onto the ASF1a globular N-terminal domain in a manner that mimics its histone H3 client. Disrupting either catalytic or non-catalytic interactions through mutagenesis hampers ASF1 phosphorylation by TLK2 and cell growth. Our results suggest that the stringent selectivity of TLKs for ASF1 is enforced by an unusual interaction mode involving mutual recognition of a short sequence motifs by both kinase and substrate.",

To gain insight into their recognition, we determined crystal structures of four llama nanobodies (J3, A12, C8, and D7), all of which targeted the CD4-binding site, in complex with the HIV-1 envelope (Env) gp120 core, and determined a cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of J3 with the Env trimer. Crystal and cryo-EM structures of J3 complexes revealed this nanobody to mimic binding to the prefusion-closed trimer for the primary site of CD4 recognition as well as a secondary quaternary site. In contrast, crystal structures of A12, C8, and D7 with gp120 revealed epitopes that included portions of the gp120 inner domain, inaccessible on the prefusion-closed trimer. Overall, these structures explain the broad and potent neutralization of J3 and limited neutralization of A12, C8, and D7, which utilized binding modes incompatible with the neutralization-targeted prefusion-closed conformation of Env.",

Detailed structural information is available for these soluble protein-FA complexes, but the structure of the protein conformation responsible for FA exchange at the membrane is unknown. Staphylococcus aureus FakB1 is a prototypical bacterial FA transfer protein that binds palmitate within a narrow, buried tunnel. Here, we define the conformational change from a \"closed\" FakB1 state to an \"open\" state that associates with the membrane and provides a path for entry and egress of the FA. Using NMR spectroscopy, we identified a conformationally flexible dynamic region in FakB1, and X-ray crystallography of FakB1 mutants captured the conformation of the open state. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations show that the new amphipathic \u03b1-helix formed in the open state inserts below the phosphate plane of the bilayer to create a diffusion channel for the hydrophobic FA tail to access the hydrocarbon core and place the carboxyl group at the phosphate layer. The membrane binding and catalytic properties of site-directed mutants were consistent with the proposed membrane docked structure predicted by our molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, the structure of the bilayer-associated conformation of FakB1 has local similarities with mammalian FA binding proteins and provides a conceptual framework for how these proteins interact with the membrane to create a diffusion channel from the FA location in the bilayer to the protein interior.",

Both the apo-Kv1.3 and dalazatide-Kv1.3 structures are in an activated state based on their depolarized voltage sensor and open inner gate. In apo-Kv1.3, the aromatic residue in the signature sequence (Y447) adopts a position that diverges 11 \u00c5 from other K<sup>+</sup> channels. The outer pore is significantly rearranged, causing widening of the selectivity filter and perturbation of ion binding within the filter. This conformation is stabilized by a network of intrasubunit hydrogen bonds. In dalazatide-Kv1.3, binding of dalazatide to the channel's outer vestibule narrows the selectivity filter, Y447 occupies a position seen in other K<sup>+</sup> channels, and this conformation is stabilized by a network of intersubunit hydrogen bonds. These remarkable rearrangements in the selectivity filter underlie Kv1.3's transition into the drug-blocked state.",

    "abstract": "S-acylation, also known as palmitoylation, is the most abundant form of protein lipidation in humans. This reversible posttranslational modification, which targets thousands of proteins, is catalyzed by 23 members of the DHHC family of integral membrane enzymes. DHHC enzymes use fatty acyl-CoA as the ubiquitous fatty acyl donor and become autoacylated at a catalytic cysteine; this intermediate subsequently transfers the fatty acyl group to a cysteine in the target protein. Protein S-acylation intersects with almost all areas of human physiology, and several DHHC enzymes are considered as possible therapeutic targets against diseases such as cancer. These efforts would greatly benefit from a detailed understanding of the molecular basis for this crucial enzymatic reaction. Here, we combine X-ray crystallography with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the structure of the precatalytic complex of human DHHC20 in complex with palmitoyl CoA. The resulting structure reveals that the fatty acyl chain inserts into a hydrophobic pocket within the transmembrane spanning region of the protein, whereas the CoA headgroup is recognized by the cytosolic domain through polar and ionic interactions. Biochemical experiments corroborate the predictions from our structural model. We show, using both computational and experimental analyses, that palmitoyl CoA acts as a bivalent ligand where the interaction of the DHHC enzyme with both the fatty acyl chain and the CoA headgroup is important for catalytic chemistry to proceed. This bivalency explains how, in the presence of high concentrations of free CoA under physiological conditions, DHHC enzymes can efficiently use palmitoyl CoA as a substrate for autoacylation.",

    "abstract": "The high mutation rate of COVID-19 and the prevalence of multiple variants strongly support the need for pharmacological options to complement vaccine strategies. One region that appears highly conserved among different genera of coronaviruses is the substrate-binding site of the main protease (M<sup>pro</sup> or 3CL<sup>pro</sup>), making it an attractive target for the development of broad-spectrum drugs for multiple coronaviruses. PF-07321332, developed by Pfizer, is the first orally administered inhibitor targeting the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, which also has shown potency against other coronaviruses. Here, we report three crystal structures of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV bound to the inhibitor PF-07321332. The structures reveal a ligand-binding site that is conserved among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, providing insights into the mechanism of inhibition of viral replication. The long and narrow cavity in the cleft between domains I and II of the main protease harbors multiple inhibitor-binding sites, where PF-07321332 occupies subsites S1, S2, and S4 and appears more restricted than other inhibitors. A detailed analysis of these structures illuminated key structural determinants essential for inhibition and elucidated the binding mode of action of the main proteases from different coronaviruses. Given the importance of the main protease for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, insights derived from this study should accelerate the design of safer and more effective antivirals. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The current pandemic of multiple variants has created an urgent need for effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 to complement vaccine strategies. PF-07321332, developed by Pfizer, is the first orally administered coronavirus-specific main protease inhibitor approved by the FDA. We solved the crystal structures of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV that bound to the PF-07321332, suggesting PF-07321332 is a broad-spectrum inhibitor for coronaviruses. Structures of the main protease inhibitor complexes present an opportunity to discover safer and more effective inhibitors for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) challenge currently available COVID-19 vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies due to structural and dynamic changes of the viral spike glycoprotein (S). The heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domains of S drive virus\u2013host membrane fusion by assembly into a six-helix bundle, resulting in delivery of viral RNA into the host cell. We surveyed mutations of currently reported SARS-CoV-2 variants and selected eight mutations, including Q954H, N969K, and L981F from the Omicron variant, in the postfusion HR1HR2 bundle for functional and structural studies. We designed a molecular scaffold to determine cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of HR1HR2 at 2.2\u20133.8 \u00c5 resolution by linking the trimeric N termini of four HR1 fragments to four trimeric C termini of the Dps4 dodecamer from Nostoc punctiforme. This molecular scaffold enables efficient sample preparation and structure determination of the HR1HR2 bundle and its mutants by single-particle cryo-EM. Our structure of the wild-type HR1HR2 bundle resolves uncertainties in previously determined structures. The mutant structures reveal side-chain positions of the mutations and their primarily local effects on the interactions between HR1 and HR2. These mutations do not alter the global architecture of the postfusion HR1HR2 bundle, suggesting that the interfaces between HR1 and HR2 are good targets for developing antiviral inhibitors that should be efficacious against all known variants of SARS-CoV-2 to date. We also note that this work paves the way for similar studies in more distantly related viruses.",

    "abstract": "VPS13 proteins are proposed to function at contact sites between organelles as bridges for lipids to move directionally and in bulk between organellar membranes. VPS13s are anchored between membranes via interactions with receptors, including both peripheral and integral membrane proteins. Here we present the crystal structure of VPS13s adaptor binding domain (VAB) complexed with a Pro-X-Pro peptide recognition motif present in one such receptor, the integral membrane protein Mcp1p, and show biochemically that other Pro-X-Pro motifs bind the VAB in the same site. We further demonstrate that Mcp1p and another integral membrane protein that interacts directly with human VPS13A, XK, are scramblases. This finding supports an emerging paradigm of a partnership between bulk lipid transport proteins and scramblases. Scramblases can re-equilibrate lipids between membrane leaflets as lipids are removed from or inserted into the cytosolic leaflet of donor and acceptor organelles, respectively, in the course of protein-mediated transport.",

    "abstract": "Insulin regulates glucose homeostasis via binding and activation of the insulin receptor dimer at two distinct pairs of binding sites 1 and 2. Here, we present cryo-EM studies of full-length human insulin receptor (hIR) in an active state obtained at non-saturating, physiologically relevant insulin conditions. Insulin binds asymmetrically to the receptor under these conditions, occupying up to three of the four possible binding sites. Deletion analysis of the receptor together with site specific peptides and insulin analogs used in binding studies show that both sites 1 and 2 are required for high insulin affinity. We identify a homotypic interaction of the fibronectin type III domain (FnIII-3) of IR resulting in tight interaction of membrane proximal domains of the active, asymmetric receptor dimer. Our results show how insulin binding at two distinct types of sites disrupts the autoinhibited apo-IR dimer and stabilizes the active dimer. We propose an insulin binding and activation mechanism, which is sequential, exhibits negative cooperativity, and is based on asymmetry at physiological insulin concentrations with one to three insulin molecules activating IR.",

    "abstract": "The MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a highly pathogenic, emerging virus that produces accessory proteins to antagonize the host innate immune response. The MERS-CoV ORF4b protein has been shown to bind preferentially to the nuclear import adapter IMP\u03b13 in infected cells, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB-dependent innate immune responses. Here, we report high-resolution structures of ORF4b bound to two distinct IMP\u03b1 family members. Each exhibit highly similar binding mechanisms that, in both cases, lack a prototypical Lys bound at their P2 site. Mutations within the NLS region dramatically alter the mechanism of binding, which reverts to the canonical P2 Lys binding mechanism. Mutational studies confirm that the novel binding mechanism is important for its nuclear import, IMP\u03b1 interaction, and inhibition of innate immune signaling pathways. In parallel, we determined structures of the nuclear binding domain of NF-\u03baB component p50 bound to both IMP\u03b12 and \u03b13, demonstrating that p50 overlaps with the ORF4b binding sites, suggesting a basis for inhibition. Our results provide a detailed structural basis that explains how a virus can target the IMP\u03b1 nuclear import adapter to impair immunity, and illustrate how small mutations in ORF4b, like those found in closely related coronaviruses such as HKU5, change the IMP\u03b1 binding mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The design of proteins that bind to a specific site on the surface of a target protein using no information other than the three-dimensional structure of the target remains a challenge<sup>1-5</sup>. Here we describe a general solution to this problem that starts with a broad exploration of the vast space of possible binding modes to a selected region of a protein surface, and then intensifies the search in the vicinity of the most promising binding modes. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach through the de novo design of binding proteins to 12 diverse protein targets with different shapes and surface properties. Biophysical characterization shows that the binders, which are all smaller than 65 amino acids, are hyperstable and, following experimental optimization, bind their targets with nanomolar to picomolar affinities. We succeeded in solving crystal structures of five of the binder-target complexes, and all five closely match the corresponding computational design models. Experimental data on nearly half a million computational designs and hundreds of thousands of point mutants provide detailed feedback on the strengths and limitations of the method and of our current understanding of protein-protein interactions, and should guide improvements of both. Our approach enables the targeted design of binders to sites of interest on a wide variety of proteins for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.",

    "abstract": "Spindle- or lemon-shaped viruses infect archaea in diverse environments. Due to the highly pleomorphic nature of these virions, which can be found with cylindrical tails emanating from the spindle-shaped body, structural studies of these capsids have been challenging. We have determined the atomic structure of the capsid of Sulfolobus monocaudavirus 1, a virus that infects hosts living in nearly boiling acid. A highly hydrophobic protein, likely integrated into the host membrane before the virions assemble, forms 7 strands that slide past each other in both the tails and the spindle body. We observe the discrete steps that occur as the tail tubes expand, and these are due to highly conserved quasiequivalent interactions with neighboring subunits maintained despite significant diameter changes. Our results show how helical assemblies can vary their diameters, becoming nearly spherical to package a larger genome and suggest how all spindle-shaped viruses have evolved from archaeal rod-like viruses.",

    "abstract": "<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (SA) leukocidin ED (LukED) belongs to a family of bicomponent pore forming toxins that play important roles in SA immune evasion and nutrient acquisition. LukED targets specific G protein-coupled chemokine receptors to lyse human erythrocytes (red blood cells) and leukocytes (white blood cells). The first recognition step of receptors is critical for specific cell targeting and lysis. The structural and molecular bases for this mechanism are not well understood but could constitute essential information to guide antibiotic development. Here, we characterized the interaction of LukE with chemokine receptors ACKR1, CCR2, and CCR5 using a combination of structural, pharmacological, and computational approaches. First, crystal structures of LukE in complex with a small molecule mimicking sulfotyrosine side chain (p-cresyl sulfate) and with peptides containing sulfotyrosines issued from receptor sequences revealed the location of receptor sulfotyrosine binding sites in the toxins. Then, by combining previous and novel experimental data with protein docking, classical and accelerated weight histogram (AWH) molecular dynamics we propose models of the ACKR1-LukE and CCR5-LukE complexes. This work provides novel insights into chemokine receptor recognition by leukotoxins and suggests that the conserved sulfotyrosine binding pocket could be a target of choice for future drug development.",

Inteins that contain an additional site-specific endonuclease domain display genetic mobility via a process termed \"homing\" and thereby act as selfish DNA elements. We elucidated the crystal structures of two archaeal inteins associated with an active or inactive homing endonuclease domain. This analysis illustrated structural diversity in the accessory domains (ACDs) associated with the homing endonuclease domain. To augment homing endonucleases with highly specific DNA cleaving activity using the intein scaffold, we engineered the ACDs and characterized their homing site recognition. Protein engineering of the ACDs in the inteins illuminated a possible strategy for how inteins could avoid their extinction but spread via the acquisition of a diverse accessory domain.",

    "abstract": "The fungal class D1 G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Ste2 has a different arrangement of transmembrane helices compared with mammalian GPCRs and a distinct mode of coupling to the heterotrimeric G protein Gpa1-Ste2-Ste18<sup>1</sup>. In addition, Ste2 lacks conserved sequence motifs such as DRY, PIF and NPXXY, which are associated with the activation of class A GPCRs<sup>2</sup>. This suggested that the activation mechanism of Ste2 may also differ. Here we determined structures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ste2 in the absence of G protein in two different conformations bound to the native agonist \u03b1-factor, bound to an antagonist and without ligand. These structures revealed that Ste2 is indeed activated differently from other GPCRs. In the inactive state, the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane helix H7 is unstructured and packs between helices H1-H6, blocking the G protein coupling site. Agonist binding results in the outward movement of the extracellular ends of H6 and H7 by 6\u2009\u00c5. On the intracellular surface, the G protein coupling site is formed by a 20\u2009\u00c5 outward movement of the unstructured region in H7 that unblocks the site, and a 12\u2009\u00c5 inward movement of H6. This is a distinct mechanism in GPCRs, in which the movement of H6 and H7 upon agonist binding facilitates G protein coupling.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues worldwide with many variants arising, some of which are variants of concern (VOCs). A recent VOC, omicron (B.1.1.529), which obtains a large number of mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, has risen to intense scientific and public attention. Here, we studied the binding properties between the human receptor ACE2 (hACE2) and the VOC RBDs and resolved the crystal and cryoelectron microscopy structures of the omicron RBD-hACE2 complex as well as the crystal structure of the delta RBD-hACE2 complex. We found that, unlike alpha, beta, and gamma, omicron RBD binds to hACE2 at a similar affinity to that of the prototype RBD, which might be due to compensation of multiple mutations for both immune escape and transmissibility. The complex structures of omicron RBD-hACE2 and delta RBD-hACE2 reveal the structural basis of how RBD-specific mutations bind to hACE2.",

BoNT serotype A and B in particular pose the most serious threat to humans because of their high potency and persistence. To date, there is no effective treatment for late post-exposure therapy of botulism patients. Here, we aim to develop single-domain variable heavy-chain (VHH) antibodies targeting the protease domains (also known as the light chain, LC) of BoNT/A and BoNT/B as antidotes for post-intoxication treatments. Using a combination of X-ray crystallography and biochemical assays, we investigated the structures and inhibition mechanisms of a dozen unique VHHs that recognize four and three non-overlapping epitopes on the LC of BoNT/A and BoNT/B, respectively. We show that the VHHs that inhibit the LC activity occupy the extended substrate-recognition exosites or the cleavage pocket of LC/A or LC/B and thus block substrate binding. Notably, we identified several VHHs that recognize highly conserved epitopes across BoNT/A or BoNT/B subtypes, suggesting that these VHHs exhibit broad subtype efficacy. Further, we identify two novel conformations of the full-length LC/A, that could aid future development of inhibitors against BoNT/A. Our studies lay the foundation for structure-based engineering of protein- or peptide-based BoNT inhibitors with enhanced potencies and cross-subtypes properties.",

    "abstract": "Alphaviruses such as Ross River virus (RRV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Sindbis virus (SINV), and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) are mosquito-borne pathogens that can cause arthritis or encephalitis diseases. Nonstructural protein 4 (nsP4) of alphaviruses possesses RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity essential for viral RNA replication. No 3D structure has been available for nsP4 of any alphaviruses despite its importance for understanding alphaviral RNA replication and for the design of antiviral drugs. Here, we report crystal structures of the RdRp domain of nsP4 from both RRV and SINV determined at resolutions of 2.6 \u00c5 and 1.9 \u00c5. The structure of the alphavirus RdRp domain appears most closely related to RdRps from pestiviruses, noroviruses, and picornaviruses. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods showed that in solution, nsP4 is highly dynamic with an intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain. Both full-length nsP4 and the RdRp domain were capable to catalyze RNA polymerization. Structure-guided mutagenesis using a trans-replicase system identified nsP4 regions critical for viral RNA replication.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic antibody development requires discovery of an antibody molecule with desired specificities and drug-like properties. For toxicological studies, a therapeutic antibody must bind the ortholog antigen with a similar affinity to the human target to enable relevant dosing regimens, and antibodies falling short of this affinity design goal may not progress as therapeutic leads. Herein, we report the novel use of mammalian recombination signal sequence (RSS)-directed recombination for complementarity-determining region-targeted protein engineering combined with mammalian display to close the species affinity gap of human interleukin (IL)-13 antibody 731. This fully human antibody has not progressed as a therapeutic in part because of a 400-fold species affinity gap. Using this nonhypothesis-driven affinity maturation method, we generated multiple antibody variants with improved IL-13 affinity, including the highest affinity antibody reported to date (34\u00a0fM). Resolution of a cocrystal structure of the optimized antibody with the cynomolgus monkey (or nonhuman primate) IL-13 protein revealed that the RSS-derived mutations introduced multiple successive amino-acid substitutions resulting in a de novo formation of a \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking-based protein-protein interaction between the affinity-matured antibody heavy chain and helix C on IL-13, as well as an introduction of an interface-distant residue, which enhanced the light chain-binding affinity to target. These mutations synergized binding of heavy and light chains to the target protein, resulting in a remarkably tight interaction, and providing a proof of concept for a new method of protein engineering, based on synergizing a mammalian display platform with novel RSS-mediated library generation.",

    "abstract": "Enzymes in the thiol redox systems of microbial pathogens are promising targets for drug development. In this study we characterized the thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) selenoproteins from Brugia malayi and Onchocerca volvulus, filarial nematode parasites and causative agents of lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis, respectively. The two filarial enzymes showed similar turnover numbers and affinities for different thioredoxin (Trx) proteins, but with a clear preference for the autologous Trx. Human TrxR1 (hTrxR1) had a high and similar specific activity versus the human and filarial Trxs, suggesting that, in vivo, hTrxR1 could possibly be the reducing agent of parasite Trxs once they are released into the host. Both filarial TrxRs were efficiently inhibited by auranofin and by a recently described inhibitor of human TrxR1 (TRi-1), but not as efficiently by the alternative compound TRi-2. The enzyme from B. malayi was structurally characterized also in complex with NADPH and auranofin, producing the first crystallographic structure of a nematode TrxR. The protein represents an unusual fusion of a mammalian-type TrxR protein architecture with an N-terminal glutaredoxin-like (Grx) domain lacking typical Grx motifs. Unlike thioredoxin glutathione reductases (TGRs) found in platyhelminths and mammals, which are also Grx-TrxR domain fusion proteins, the TrxRs from the filarial nematodes lacked glutathione disulfide reductase and Grx activities. The structural determinations revealed that the Grx domain of TrxR from B. malayi contains a cysteine (C22), conserved in TrxRs from clade IIIc nematodes, that directly interacts with the C-terminal cysteine-selenocysteine motif of the homo-dimeric subunit. Interestingly, despite this finding we found that altering C22 by mutation to serine did not affect enzyme catalysis. Thus, although the function of the Grx domain in these filarial TrxRs remains to be determined, the results obtained provide insights on key properties of this important family of selenoprotein flavoenzymes that are potential drug targets for treatment of filariasis.",

    "abstract": "Abundant filamentous inclusions of tau are characteristic of more than 20 neurodegenerative diseases that are collectively termed tauopathies. Electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of tau amyloid filaments from human brain revealed that distinct tau folds characterise many different diseases. A lack of laboratory-based model systems to generate these structures has hampered efforts to uncover the molecular mechanisms that underlie tauopathies. Here, we report in vitro assembly conditions with recombinant tau that replicate the structures of filaments from both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), as determined by cryo-EM. Our results suggest that post-translational modifications of tau modulate filament assembly, and that previously observed additional densities in AD and CTE filaments may arise from the presence of inorganic salts, like phosphates and sodium chloride. In vitro assembly of tau into disease-relevant filaments will facilitate studies to determine their roles in different diseases, as well as the development of compounds that specifically bind to these structures or prevent their formation.",

Several anaerobic microorganisms encode multiple CODHs in their genome, of which some, despite being annotated as CODHs, lack a cysteine of the canonical binding motif for the active site Ni,Fe-cluster. Here, we report on the structure and reactivity of such a deviant enzyme, termed CooS-V<sub>Ch</sub> . Its structure reveals the typical CODH scaffold, but contains an iron-sulfur-oxo hybrid-cluster. Although closely related to true CODHs, CooS-V<sub>Ch</sub> catalyzes neither CO oxidation, nor CO<sub>2</sub> reduction. The active site of CooS-V<sub>Ch</sub> undergoes a redox-dependent restructuring between a reduced [4Fe-3S]-cluster and an oxidized [4Fe-2S-S*-2O-2(H<sub>2</sub> O)]-cluster. Hydroxylamine, a slow-turnover substrate of CooS-V<sub>Ch</sub> , oxidizes the hybrid-cluster in two structurally distinct steps. Overall, minor changes in CODHs are sufficient to accommodate a Fe/S/O-cluster in place of the Ni,Fe-heterocubane-cluster of CODHs.",

    "abstract": "Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is an essential enzyme with a complex mechanism of allosteric regulation found in nearly all living organisms. Class I RNRs are composed of two proteins, a large \u03b1-subunit (R1) and a smaller \u03b2-subunit (R2) that exist as homodimers, that combine to form an active heterotetramer. <i>Aquifex aeolicus</i> is a hyperthermophilic bacterium with an unusual RNR encoding a 346-residue intein in the DNA sequence encoding its R2 subunit. We present the first structures of the <i>A. aeolicus</i> R1 and R2 (AaR1 and AaR2, respectively) proteins as well as the biophysical and biochemical characterization of active and inactive <i>A. aeolicus</i> RNR. While the active oligomeric state and activity regulation of <i>A. aeolicus</i> RNR are similar to those of other characterized RNRs, the X-ray crystal structures also reveal distinct features and adaptations. Specifically, AaR1 contains a \u03b2-hairpin hook structure at the dimer interface, which has an interesting \u03c0-stacking interaction absent in other members of the NrdAh subclass, and its ATP cone houses two ATP molecules. We determined structures of two AaR2 proteins: one purified from a construct lacking the intein (AaR2) and a second purified from a construct including the intein sequence (AaR2_genomic). These structures in the context of metal content analysis and activity data indicate that AaR2_genomic displays much higher iron occupancy and activity compared to AaR2, suggesting that the intein is important for facilitating complete iron incorporation, particularly in the Fe2 site of the mature R2 protein, which may be important for the survival of <i>A. aeolicus</i> in low-oxygen environments.",

    "abstract": "Depolarizing sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) leak currents carried by the NALCN channel regulate the resting membrane potential of many neurons to modulate respiration, circadian rhythm, locomotion and pain sensitivity<sup>1-8</sup>. NALCN requires FAM155A, UNC79 and UNC80 to function, but the role of these auxiliary subunits is not understood<sup>3,7,9-12</sup>. NALCN, UNC79 and UNC80 are essential in rodents<sup>2,9,13</sup>, and mutations in human NALCN and UNC80 cause severe developmental and neurological disease<sup>14,15</sup>. Here we determined the structure of the NALCN channelosome, an approximately 1-MDa complex, as fundamental aspects about the composition, assembly and gating of this channelosome remain obscure. UNC79 and UNC80 are massive HEAT-repeat proteins that form an intertwined anti-parallel superhelical assembly, which docks intracellularly onto the NALCN-FAM155A pore-forming subcomplex. Calmodulin copurifies bound to the carboxy-terminal domain of NALCN, identifying this region as a putative modulatory hub. Single-channel analyses uncovered a low open probability for the wild-type complex, highlighting the tightly closed S6 gate in the structure, and providing a basis to interpret the altered gating properties of disease-causing variants. Key constraints between the UNC79-UNC80 subcomplex and the NALCN DI-DII and DII-DIII linkers were identified, leading to a model of channelosome gating. Our results provide a structural blueprint to understand the physiology of the NALCN channelosome and a template for drug discovery to modulate the resting membrane potential.",

    "abstract": "Sliding clamps are ring-shaped protein complexes that are integral to the DNA replication machinery of all life. Sliding clamps are opened and installed onto DNA by clamp loader AAA+ ATPase complexes. However, how a clamp loader opens and closes the sliding clamp around DNA is still unknown. Here, we describe structures of the <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> clamp loader Replication Factor C (RFC) bound to its cognate sliding clamp Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) en route to successful loading. RFC first binds to PCNA in a dynamic, closed conformation that blocks both ATPase activity and DNA binding. RFC then opens the PCNA ring through a large-scale 'crab-claw' expansion of both RFC and PCNA that explains how RFC prefers initial binding of PCNA over DNA. Next, the open RFC:PCNA complex binds DNA and interrogates the primer-template junction using a surprising base-flipping mechanism. Our structures indicate that initial PCNA opening and subsequent closure around DNA do not require ATP hydrolysis, but are driven by binding energy. ATP hydrolysis, which is necessary for RFC release, is triggered by interactions with both PCNA and DNA, explaining RFC's switch-like ATPase activity. Our work reveals how a AAA+ machine undergoes dramatic conformational changes for achieving binding preference and substrate remodeling.",

The synergistic inhibition of monoamine oxidase B (MAO B) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is believed to provide a potentiated effect in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Among previously reported micromolar or sub-micromolar coumarin-bearing dual inhibitors, compound <b>1</b> returned a tight-binding inhibition of MAO B (<i>K</i> <sub><i>i</i></sub> = 4.5 \u03bcM) and a +5.5 \u00b0C increase in the enzyme <i>T</i> <sub>m</sub> value. Indeed, the X-ray crystal structure revealed that binding of <b>1</b> produces unforeseen conformational changes at the MAO B entrance cavity. Interestingly, <b>1</b> showed great shape complementarity with the AChE enzymatic gorge, being deeply buried from the catalytic anionic subsite (CAS) to the peripheral anionic subsite (PAS) and causing significant structural changes in the active site. These findings provide structural templates for further development of dual MAO B and AChE inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "During translation, a conserved GTPase elongation factor-EF-G in bacteria or eEF2 in eukaryotes-translocates tRNA and mRNA through the ribosome. EF-G has been proposed to act as a flexible motor that propels tRNA and mRNA movement, as a rigid pawl that biases unidirectional translocation resulting from ribosome rearrangements, or by various combinations of motor- and pawl-like mechanisms. Using time-resolved cryo-EM, we visualized GTP-catalyzed translocation without inhibitors, capturing elusive structures of ribosome\u2022EF-G intermediates at near-atomic resolution. Prior to translocation, EF-G binds near peptidyl-tRNA, while the rotated 30S subunit stabilizes the EF-G GTPase center. Reverse 30S rotation releases Pi and translocates peptidyl-tRNA and EF-G by ~20\u2009\u00c5. An additional 4-\u00c5 translocation initiates EF-G dissociation from a transient ribosome state with highly swiveled 30S head. The structures visualize how nearly rigid EF-G rectifies inherent and spontaneous ribosomal dynamics into tRNA-mRNA translocation, whereas GTP hydrolysis and Pi release drive EF-G dissociation.",

NF1 inhibits cellular proliferation through its guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein (GAP) activity against rat sarcoma (RAS). In the present study, cryo-electron microscope studies reveal that the human ~640-kDa NF1 homodimer features a gigantic 30\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009nm array of \u03b1-helices that form a core lemniscate-shaped scaffold. Three-dimensional variability analysis captured the catalytic GAP-related domain and lipid-binding SEC-PH domains positioned against the core scaffold in a closed, autoinhibited conformation. We postulate that interaction with the plasma membrane may release the closed conformation to promote RAS inactivation. Our structural data further allow us to map the location of disease-associated NF1 variants and provide a long-sought-after structural explanation for the extreme susceptibility of the molecule to loss-of-function mutations. Collectively these findings present potential new routes for therapeutic modulation of the RAS pathway.",

    "abstract": "The core of HIV-1 viruses bearing the capsid change N74D (HIV-1-N74D) do not bind the human protein CPSF6. In primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, HIV-1-N74D viruses exhibit an infectivity defect when compared to wild-type. We first investigated whether loss of CPSF6 binding accounts for the loss of infectivity. Depletion of CPSF6 in human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells did not affect the early stages of wild-type HIV-1 replication, suggesting that defective infectivity in the case of HIV-1-N74D viruses is not due to the loss of CPSF6 binding. Based on our previous result that cyclophilin A (Cyp A) protected HIV-1 from human tripartite motif-containing protein 5\u03b1 (TRIM5\u03b1<sub>hu</sub>) restriction in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we found that depletion of TRIM5\u03b1<sub>hu</sub> in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells rescued the infectivity of HIV-1-N74D, suggesting that HIV-1-N74D cores interacted with TRIM5\u03b1<sub>hu</sub>. Accordingly, TRIM5\u03b1<sub>hu</sub> binding to HIV-1-N74D cores was increased compared with that of wild-type cores, and consistently, HIV-1-N74D cores lost their ability to bind Cyp A. In agreement with the notion that N74D capsids are defective in their ability to bind Cyp A, we found that HIV-1-N74D viruses were 20-fold less sensitive to TRIMCyp restriction when compared to wild-type viruses in OMK cells. Structural analysis revealed that N74D hexameric capsid protein in complex with PF74 is different from wild-type hexameric capsid protein in complex with PF74, which explains the defect of N74D capsids to interact with Cyp A. In conclusion, we showed that the decreased infectivity of HIV-1-N74D in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is due to a loss of Cyp A protection from TRIM5\u03b1<sub>hu</sub> restriction activity.",

    "abstract": "The main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>) is a validated antiviral drug target of SARS-CoV-2. A number of M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors have now advanced to animal model study and human clinical trials. However, one issue yet to be addressed is the target selectivity over host proteases such as cathepsin L. In this study we describe the rational design of covalent SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors with novel cysteine reactive warheads including dichloroacetamide, dibromoacetamide, tribromoacetamide, 2-bromo-2,2-dichloroacetamide, and 2-chloro-2,2-dibromoacetamide. The promising lead candidates <b>Jun9-62-2R</b> (dichloroacetamide) and <b>Jun9-88-6R</b> (tribromoacetamide) had not only potent enzymatic inhibition and antiviral activity but also significantly improved target specificity over caplain and cathepsins. Compared to <b>GC-376</b>, these new compounds did not inhibit the host cysteine proteases including calpain I, cathepsin B, cathepsin K, cathepsin L, and caspase-3. To the best of our knowledge, they are among the most selective covalent M<sup>pro</sup> inhibitors reported thus far. The cocrystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> with <b>Jun9-62-2R</b> and <b>Jun9-57-3R</b> reaffirmed our design hypothesis, showing that both compounds form a covalent adduct with the catalytic C145. Overall, these novel compounds represent valuable chemical probes for target validation and drug candidates for further development as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between sample thickness and quality of data obtained is investigated by microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED). Several electron microscopy (EM) grids containing proteinase K microcrystals of similar sizes from the same crystallization batch were prepared. Each grid was transferred into a focused ion beam and a scanning electron microscope in which the crystals were then systematically thinned into lamellae between 95- and 1,650-nm thick. MicroED data were collected at either 120-, 200-, or 300-kV accelerating voltages. Lamellae thicknesses were expressed in multiples of the corresponding inelastic mean free path to allow the results from different acceleration voltages to be compared. The quality of the data and subsequently determined structures were assessed using standard crystallographic measures. Structures were reliably determined with similar quality from crystalline lamellae up to twice the inelastic mean free path. Lower resolution diffraction was observed at three times the mean free path for all three accelerating voltages, but the data quality was insufficient to yield structures. Finally, no coherent diffraction was observed from lamellae thicker than four times the calculated inelastic mean free path. This study benchmarks the ideal specimen thickness with implications for all cryo-EM methods.",

These may alter the antigenic structure of S, causing escape from natural or vaccine-induced immunity. Beta is particularly difficult to neutralize using serum induced by early pandemic SARS-CoV-2 strains and is most antigenically separated from Delta. To understand this, we generated 674 mAbs from Beta-infected individuals and performed a detailed structure-function analysis of the 27 most potent mAbs: one binding the spike N-terminal domain (NTD), the rest the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Two of these RBD-binding mAbs recognize a neutralizing epitope conserved between SARS-CoV-1 and -2, while 18 target mutated residues in Beta: K417N, E484K, and N501Y. There is a major response to N501Y, including a public IgVH4-39 sequence, with E484K and K417N also targeted. Recognition of these key residues underscores why serum from Beta cases poorly neutralizes early pandemic and Delta viruses.",

Functional coupling of r-protein assembly with the stabilisation and maturation of subunit precursors potentially promotes the production of ribosomes with defined composition. To further decipher mechanisms of such an intrinsic quality control pathway we analysed here the contribution of three yeast large ribosomal subunit r-proteins rpL2 (uL2), rpL25 (uL23) and rpL34 (eL34) for intermediate nuclear subunit folding steps. Structure models obtained from single particle cryo-electron microscopy analyses provided evidence for specific and hierarchic effects on the stable positioning and remodelling of large ribosomal subunit domains. Based on these structural and previous biochemical data we discuss possible mechanisms of r-protein dependent hierarchic domain arrangement and the resulting impact on the stability of misassembled subunits.",

    "abstract": "The ancestral origins of the lytic cell death mode, necroptosis, lie in host defense. However, the dysregulation of necroptosis in inflammatory diseases has led to widespread interest in targeting the pathway therapeutically. This mode of cell death is executed by the terminal effector, the MLKL pseudokinase, which is licensed to kill following phosphorylation by its upstream regulator, RIPK3 kinase. The precise molecular details underlying MLKL activation are still emerging and, intriguingly, appear to mechanistically-diverge between species. Here, we report the structure of the human RIPK3 kinase domain alone and in complex with the MLKL pseudokinase. These structures reveal how human RIPK3 structurally differs from its mouse counterpart, and how human RIPK3 maintains MLKL in an inactive conformation prior to induction of necroptosis. Residues within the RIPK3:MLKL C-lobe interface are crucial to complex assembly and necroptotic signaling in human cells, thereby rationalizing the strict species specificity governing RIPK3 activation of MLKL.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial human pathogens secrete initially inactive nucleotidyl cyclases that become potent enzymes by binding to actin inside eukaryotic host cells. The underlying molecular mechanism of this activation is, however, unclear. Here, we report structures of ExoY from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Vibrio vulnificus bound to their corresponding activators F-actin and profilin-G-actin. The structures reveal that in contrast to the apo-state, two flexible regions become ordered and interact strongly with actin. The specific stabilization of these regions results in an allosteric stabilization of the nucleotide binding pocket and thereby to an activation of the enzyme. Differences in the sequence and conformation of the actin-binding regions are responsible for the selective binding to either F- or G-actin. Other nucleotidyl cyclase toxins that bind to calmodulin rather than actin undergo a similar disordered-to-ordered transition during activation, suggesting that the allosteric activation-by-stabilization mechanism of ExoY is conserved in these enzymes, albeit the different activator.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have examined the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants on neutralizing antibody activity after they have become dominant strains. Here, we evaluate the consequences of further viral evolution. We demonstrate mechanisms through which the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) can tolerate large numbers of simultaneous antibody escape mutations and show that pseudotypes containing up to seven mutations, as opposed to the one to three found in previously studied variants of concern, are more resistant to neutralization by therapeutic antibodies and serum from vaccine recipients. We identify an antibody that binds the RBD core to neutralize pseudotypes for all tested variants but show that the RBD can acquire an N-linked glycan to escape neutralization. Our findings portend continued emergence of escape variants as SARS-CoV-2 adapts to humans.",

    "abstract": "RNA molecules can show high levels of cooperativity in their global folding and interactions with divalent ions. However, cooperativity at individual ligand-RNA interaction sites remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the binding of thiamine and methylene diphosphonic acid (MDP, a soluble structural analogue of pyrophosphate) to the thiamine pyrophosphate riboswitch. These ligands each bind weakly at proximal subsites, with 10 \u03bcM and 1 mM affinities, respectively. The affinity of MDP moderately improves when thiamine or thiamine-like fragments are pre-bound to the RNA. Covalent linking of thiamine and MDP substantially increases riboswitch binding to a notable high affinity of 20 nM. Crystal structures and single-molecule correlated chemical probing revealed favorable induced fit effects upon binding of individual ligands and, unexpectedly, a substantial thermodynamically unfavorable RNA structural rearrangement upon binding of the linked thiamine-MDP ligand. Thus, linking of two ligands of modest affinity, accompanied by an unfavorable structural rearrangement, still yields a potent linked RNA-binding compound. Since complex ligands often bind riboswitches and other RNAs at proximal subsites, principles derived from this work inform and support fragment-linking strategies for identifying small molecules that interact with RNA specifically and with high affinity.",

    "abstract": "Previous structural studies of the initiation-elongation transition of RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription have relied on the use of synthetic oligonucleotides, often artificially discontinuous to capture pol II in the initiating state. Here, we report multiple structures of initiation complexes converted de novo from a 33-subunit yeast pre-initiation complex (PIC) through catalytic activities and subsequently stalled at different template positions. We determine that PICs in the initially transcribing complex (ITC) can synthesize a transcript of \u223c26 nucleotides before transitioning to an elongation complex (EC) as determined by the loss of general transcription factors (GTFs). Unexpectedly, transition to an EC was greatly accelerated when an ITC encountered a downstream EC stalled at promoter proximal regions and resulted in a collided head-to-end dimeric EC complex. Our structural analysis reveals a dynamic state of TFIIH, the largest of GTFs, in PIC/ITC with distinct functional consequences at multiple steps on the pathway to elongation.",

CIDE-domain-containing proteins were subsequently identified among proteins involved in lipid metabolism. Given the involvement of CIDE-domain-containing proteins in cell death and lipid homeostasis, their structure and function have been intensively studied. Here, the head-to-tail helical filament structure of the CIDE domain of DNA fragmentation factor-related protein 3 (DREP3) is presented. The helical filament structure was formed by opposing positively and negatively charged interfaces of the domain and was assembled depending on protein and salt concentrations. Although conserved filament structures are observed in CIDE family members, the structure elucidated in this study and its comparison with previous structures indicated that the size and the number of molecules used in one turn vary. These findings suggest that this charged-surface-based head-to-tail helical filament structure represents a unified mechanism of CIDE-domain assembly and provides insight into the function of various forms of the filament structure of the CIDE domain in higher-order assembly for apoptotic DNA fragmentation and control of lipid-droplet size.",

We show that these variants dampen the in vitro potency of vaccine-elicited serum neutralizing antibodies and provide a structural framework for describing their immune evasion. Mutations in the B.1.617.1 (Kappa) and Delta spike glycoproteins abrogate recognition by several monoclonal antibodies via alteration of key antigenic sites, including remodeling of the Delta amino-terminal domain. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 binding affinities of the Kappa and Delta receptor binding domains are comparable to the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate, whereas B.1.617.2+ (Delta+) exhibits markedly reduced affinity.",

    "abstract": "The RNA recognition motif (RRM) binds to nucleic acids as well as proteins. More than one such domain is found in the pre-mRNA processing hnRNP proteins. While the mode of RNA recognition by RRMs is known, the molecular basis of their protein interaction remains obscure. Here we describe the mode of interaction between hnRNP L and LL with the methyltransferase SETD2. We demonstrate that for the interaction to occur, a leucine pair within a highly conserved stretch of SETD2 insert their side chains in hydrophobic pockets formed by hnRNP L RRM2. Notably, the structure also highlights that RRM2 can form a ternary complex with SETD2 and RNA. Remarkably, mutating the leucine pair in SETD2 also results in its reduced interaction with other hnRNPs. Importantly, the similarity that the mode of SETD2-hnRNP L interaction shares with other related protein-protein interactions reveals a conserved design by which splicing regulators interact with one another.",

    "abstract": "The use of unnatural fluorogenic molecules widely expands the pallet of available genetically encoded fluorescent imaging tools through the design of fluorogen activating proteins (FAPs). While there is already a handful of such probes available, each of them went through laborious cycles of in vitro screening and selection. Computational modeling approaches are evolving incredibly fast right now and are demonstrating great results in many applications, including de novo protein design. It suggests that the easier task of fine-tuning the fluorogen-binding properties of an already functional protein in silico should be readily achievable. To test this hypothesis, we used Rosetta for computational ligand docking followed by protein binding pocket redesign to further improve the previously described FAP DiB1 that is capable of binding to a BODIPY-like dye M739. Despite an inaccurate initial docking of the chromophore, the incorporated mutations nevertheless improved multiple photophysical parameters as well as the overall performance of the tag. The designed protein, DiB-RM, shows higher brightness, localization precision, and apparent photostability in protein-PAINT super-resolution imaging compared to its parental variant DiB1. Moreover, DiB-RM can be cleaved to obtain an efficient split system with enhanced performance compared to a parental DiB-split system. The possible reasons for the inaccurate ligand binding pose prediction and its consequence on the outcome of the design experiment are further discussed.",

    "abstract": "Many metabolic enzymes self-assemble into micron-scale filaments to organize and regulate metabolism. The appearance of these assemblies often coincides with large metabolic changes as in development, cancer, and stress. Yeast undergo cytoplasmic acidification upon starvation, triggering the assembly of many metabolic enzymes into filaments. However, it is unclear how these filaments assemble at the molecular level and what their role is in the yeast starvation response. CTP Synthase (CTPS) assembles into metabolic filaments across many species. Here, we characterize in vitro polymerization and investigate in vivo consequences of CTPS assembly in yeast. Cryo-EM structures reveal a pH-sensitive assembly mechanism and highly ordered filament bundles that stabilize an inactive state of the enzyme, features unique to yeast CTPS. Disruption of filaments in cells with non-assembly or pH-insensitive mutations decreases growth rate, reflecting the importance of regulated CTPS filament assembly in homeotstasis.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A viruses cause seasonal epidemics and global pandemics, representing a considerable burden to healthcare systems. Central to the replication cycle of influenza viruses is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase which transcribes and replicates the viral RNA genome. The polymerase undergoes conformational rearrangements and interacts with viral and host proteins to perform these functions. Here we determine the structure of the 1918 influenza virus polymerase in transcriptase and replicase conformations using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We then structurally and functionally characterise the binding of single-domain nanobodies to the polymerase of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus. Combining these functional and structural data we identify five sites on the polymerase which are sensitive to inhibition by nanobodies. We propose that the binding of nanobodies at these sites either prevents the polymerase from assuming particular functional conformations or interactions with viral or host factors. The polymerase is highly conserved across the influenza A subtypes, suggesting these sites as effective targets for potential influenza antiviral development.",

Here we investigate autoactivation and direct activation by BH3-only proteins, which cooperate to lower BAK threshold in membrane poration and apoptosis initiation. We define in trans BAK autoactivation as the asymmetric \"BH3-in-groove\" triggering of dormant BAK by active BAK. BAK autoactivation is mechanistically similar to direct activation. The structure of autoactivated BAK BH3-BAK complex reveals the conformational changes leading to helix \u03b11 destabilization, which is a hallmark of BAK activation. Helix \u03b11 is destabilized and restabilized in structures of BAK engaged by rationally designed, high-affinity activating and inactivating BID-like BH3 ligands, respectively. Altogether our data support the long-standing hit-and-run mechanism of BAK activation by transient binding of BH3-only proteins, demonstrating that BH3-induced structural changes are more important in BAK activation than BH3 ligand affinity.",

    "abstract": "Polyamines are important polycations that play critical roles in mammalian cells. ATP13A2 belongs to the orphan P5B adenosine triphosphatases (ATPase) family and has been established as a lysosomal polyamine exporter to maintain the normal function of lysosomes and mitochondria. Previous studies have reported that several human neurodegenerative disorders are related to mutations in the ATP13A2 gene. However, the transport mechanism of ATP13A2 in the lysosome remains unclear. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of three distinct intermediates of the human ATP13A2, revealing key insights into the spermine (SPM) transport cycle in the lysosome. The transmembrane domain serves as a substrate binding site and the C-terminal domain is essential for protein stability and may play a regulatory role. These findings advance our understanding of the polyamine transport mechanism, the lipid-associated regulation, and the disease-associated mutants of ATP13A2.",

    "abstract": "The structure has been determined by electron cryomicroscopy of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase from <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i> This analysis confirms features in a prior description of the structure of the enzyme, but it also describes other highly significant attributes not recognized before that are crucial for understanding the mechanism and regulation of the mycobacterial enzyme. First, we resolved not only the three main states in the catalytic cycle described before but also eight substates that portray structural and mechanistic changes occurring during a 360\u00b0 catalytic cycle. Second, a mechanism of auto-inhibition of ATP hydrolysis involves not only the engagement of the C-terminal region of an \u03b1-subunit in a loop in the \u03b3-subunit, as proposed before, but also a \"fail-safe\" mechanism involving the b'-subunit in the peripheral stalk that enhances engagement. A third unreported characteristic is that the fused b\u03b4-subunit contains a duplicated domain in its N-terminal region where the two copies of the domain participate in similar modes of attachment of the two of three N-terminal regions of the \u03b1-subunits. The auto-inhibitory plus the associated \"fail-safe\" mechanisms and the modes of attachment of the \u03b1-subunits provide targets for development of innovative antitubercular drugs. The structure also provides support for an observation made in the bovine ATP synthase that the transmembrane proton-motive force that provides the energy to drive the rotary mechanism is delivered directly and tangentially to the rotor via a Grotthuss water chain in a polar L-shaped tunnel.",

    "abstract": "After almost two years from its first evidence, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to afflict people worldwide, highlighting the need for multiple antiviral strategies. SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro/3CLpro) is a recognized promising target for the development of effective drugs. Because single target inhibition might not be sufficient to block SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication, multi enzymatic-based therapies may provide a better strategy. Here we present a structural and biochemical characterization of the binding mode of MG-132 to both the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, and to the human Cathepsin-L, suggesting thus an interesting scaffold for the development of double-inhibitors. X-ray diffraction data show that MG-132 well fits into the Mpro active site, forming a covalent bond with Cys145 independently from reducing agents and crystallization conditions. Docking of MG-132 into Cathepsin-L well-matches with a covalent binding to the catalytic cysteine. Accordingly, MG-132 inhibits Cathepsin-L with nanomolar potency and reversibly inhibits Mpro with micromolar potency, but with a prolonged residency time. We compared the apo and MG-132-inhibited structures of Mpro solved in different space groups and we identified a new apo structure that features several similarities with the inhibited ones, offering interesting perspectives for future drug design and in silico efforts.",

    "abstract": "The PI3K-related kinase (PIKK) SMG1 monitors the progression of metazoan nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) by phosphorylating the RNA helicase UPF1. Previous work has shown that the activity of SMG1 is impaired by small molecule inhibitors, is reduced by the SMG1 interactors SMG8 and SMG9, and is downregulated by the so-called SMG1 insertion domain. However, the molecular basis for this complex regulatory network has remained elusive. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of human SMG1-9 and SMG1-8-9 complexes bound to either a SMG1 inhibitor or a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog at overall resolutions ranging from 2.8 to 3.6 \u00c5. These structures reveal the basis with which a small molecule inhibitor preferentially targets SMG1 over other PIKKs. By comparison with our previously reported substrate-bound structure (Langer et al.,2020), we show that the SMG1 insertion domain can exert an autoinhibitory function by directly blocking the substrate-binding path as well as overall access to the SMG1 kinase active site. Together with biochemical analysis, our data indicate that SMG1 autoinhibition is stabilized by the presence of SMG8. Our results explain the specific inhibition of SMG1 by an ATP-competitive small molecule, provide insights into regulation of its kinase activity within the NMD pathway, and expand the understanding of PIKK regulatory mechanisms in general.",

    "abstract": "Plants are an excellent source of bioactive peptides, often with disulfide bonds and/or a cyclic backbone. While focus has predominantly been directed at disulfide-rich peptides, a large family of small, cyclic plant peptides lacking disulfide bonds, known as orbitides, has been relatively ignored. A recently discovered subfamily of orbitides is the PawL-derived peptides (PLPs), produced during the maturation of precursors for seed storage albumins. Although their evolutionary origins have been dated, in-depth exploration of the family's structural characteristics and potential bioactivities remains to be conducted. Here we present an extensive and systematic characterization of the PLP family. Nine PLPs were chosen and prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis. Their structural features were studied using solution NMR spectroscopy, and seven were found to possess regions of backbone order. Ordered regions consist of \u03b2-turns, with some PLPs adopting two well-defined \u03b2-turns within sequences as short as seven residues, which are largely the result of side chain interactions. Our data highlight that the sequence diversity within this family results in equally diverse structures. None of these nine PLPs showed antibacterial or antifungal activity.",

In plants, DICER-LIKE PROTEIN 3 (DCL3) produces 24-nucleotide (nt) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that determine the specificity of the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway. Here, we determined the structure of a DCL3\u2013pre-siRNA complex in an active dicing-competent state. The 5\u2032-phosphorylated A1 of the guide strand and the 1-nt 3\u2032 overhang of the complementary strand are specifically recognized by a positively charged pocket and an aromatic cap, respectively. The 24-nt siRNA length dependence relies on the separation between the 5\u2032-phosphorylated end of the guide RNA and dual cleavage sites formed by the paired ribonuclease III domains. These structural studies, complemented by functional data, provide insight into the dicing principle for Dicers in general.",

    "abstract": "The western corn rootworm (WCR), Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, is a major maize pest in the United States causing significant economic loss. The emergence of field-evolved resistant WCR to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) traits has prompted the need to discover and deploy new insecticidal proteins in transgenic maize. In the current study we determined the crystal structure and mode of action (MOA) of the Vpb4Da2 protein (formerly known as Vip4Da2) from Bt, the first identified insecticidal Vpb4 protein with commercial level control against WCR. The Vpb4Da2 structure exhibits a six-domain architecture mainly comprised of antiparallel \u03b2-sheets organized into \u03b2-sandwich layers. The amino-terminal domains 1-3 of the protein share structural homology with the protective antigen (PA) PA14 domain and encompass a long \u03b2-pore forming loop as in the clostridial binary-toxB module. Domains 5 and 6 at the carboxyl-terminal half of Vpb4Da2 are unique as this extension is not observed in PA or any other structurally-related protein other than Vpb4 homologs. These unique Vpb4 domains adopt the topologies of carbohydrate-binding modules known to participate in receptor-recognition. Functional assessment of Vpb4Da2 suggests that domains 4-6 comprise the WCR receptor binding region and are key in conferring the observed insecticidal activity against WCR. The current structural analysis was complemented by in vitro and in vivo characterizations, including immuno-histochemistry, demonstrating that Vpb4Da2 follows a MOA that is consistent with well-characterized 3-domain Bt insecticidal proteins despite significant structural differences.",

    "abstract": "GTPases are regulators of cell signaling acting as molecular switches. The translational GTPase EF-G stands out, as it uses GTP hydrolysis to generate force and promote the movement of the ribosome along the mRNA. The key unresolved question is how GTP hydrolysis drives molecular movement. Here, we visualize the GTPase-powered step of ongoing translocation by time-resolved cryo-EM. EF-G in the active GDP-Pi form stabilizes the rotated conformation of ribosomal subunits and induces twisting of the sarcin-ricin loop of the 23\u2009S rRNA. Refolding of the GTPase switch regions upon Pi release initiates a large-scale rigid-body rotation of EF-G pivoting around the sarcin-ricin loop that facilitates back rotation of the ribosomal subunits and forward swiveling of the head domain of the small subunit, ultimately driving tRNA forward movement. The findings demonstrate how a GTPase orchestrates spontaneous thermal fluctuations of a large RNA-protein complex into force-generating molecular movement.",

    "abstract": "Cytidine triphosphate synthase 1 (CTPS1) is necessary for an effective immune response, as revealed by severe immunodeficiency in CTPS1-deficient individuals [E. Martin <i>et al</i>], [<i>Nature</i>] [510], [288-292] ([2014]). CTPS1 expression is up-regulated in activated lymphocytes to expand CTP pools [E. Martin <i>et al</i>], [<i>Nature</i>] [510], [288-292] ([2014]), satisfying increased demand for nucleic acid and lipid synthesis [L. D. Fairbanks, M. Bofill, K. Ruckemann, H. A. Simmonds], [<i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> ] [270], [29682-29689] ([1995]). Demand for CTP in other tissues is met by the CTPS2 isoform and nucleoside salvage pathways [E. Martin <i>et al</i>], [<i>Nature</i>] [510], [288-292] ([2014]). Selective inhibition of the proliferative CTPS1 isoform is therefore desirable in the treatment of immune disorders and lymphocyte cancers, but little is known about differences in regulation of the isoforms or mechanisms of known inhibitors. We show that CTP regulates both isoforms by binding in two sites that clash with substrates. CTPS1 is less sensitive to CTP feedback inhibition, consistent with its role in increasing CTP levels in proliferation. We also characterize recently reported small-molecule inhibitors, both CTPS1 selective and nonselective. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures reveal these inhibitors mimic CTP binding in one inhibitory site, where a single amino acid substitution explains selectivity for CTPS1. The inhibitors bind to CTPS assembled into large-scale filaments, which for CTPS1 normally represents a hyperactive form of the enzyme [E. M. Lynch <i>et al</i>], [<i>Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol.</i>] [24], [507-514] ([2017]). This highlights the utility of cryo-EM in drug discovery, particularly for cases in which targets form large multimeric assemblies not amenable to structure determination by other techniques. Both inhibitors also inhibit the proliferation of human primary T cells. The mechanisms of selective inhibition of CTPS1 lay the foundation for the design of immunosuppressive therapies.",

    "abstract": "The cellular response to DNA damage (DDR) that causes replication collapse and/or DNA double strand breaks, is characterised by a massive change in the post-translational modifications (PTM) of hundreds of proteins involved in the detection and repair of DNA damage, and the communication of the state of damage to the cellular systems that regulate replication and cell division. A substantial proportion of these PTMs involve targeted phosphorylation, which among other effects, promotes the formation of multiprotein complexes through the specific binding of phosphorylated motifs on one protein, by specialised domains on other proteins. Understanding the nature of these phosphorylation mediated interactions allows definition of the pathways and networks that coordinate the DDR, and helps identify new targets for therapeutic intervention that may be of benefit in the treatment of cancer, where DDR plays a key role. In this review we summarise the present understanding of how phosphorylated motifs are recognised by BRCT domains, which occur in many DDR proteins. We particularly focus on TOPBP1 - a multi-BRCT domain scaffold protein with essential roles in replication and the repair and signalling of DNA damage.",

    "abstract": "Spore-forming pathogens like Clostridioides difficile depend on germination to initiate infection. During gemination, spores must degrade their cortex layer, which is a thick, protective layer of modified peptidoglycan. Cortex degradation depends on the presence of the spore-specific peptidoglycan modification, muramic-\u2202-lactam (MAL), which is specifically recognized by cortex lytic enzymes. In C. difficile, MAL production depends on the CwlD amidase and its binding partner, the GerS lipoprotein. To gain insight into how GerS regulates CwlD activity, we solved the crystal structure of the CwlD:GerS complex. In this structure, a GerS homodimer is bound to two CwlD monomers such that the CwlD active sites are exposed. Although CwlD structurally resembles amidase_3 family members, we found that CwlD does not bind Zn2+ stably on its own, unlike previously characterized amidase_3 enzymes. Instead, GerS binding to CwlD promotes CwlD binding to Zn2+, which is required for its catalytic mechanism. Thus, in determining the first structure of an amidase bound to its regulator, we reveal stabilization of Zn2+ co-factor binding as a novel mechanism for regulating bacterial amidase activity. Our results further suggest that allosteric regulation by binding partners may be a more widespread mode for regulating bacterial amidase activity than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "ParE<sub>SO</sub>-CopA<sub>SO</sub> is a new type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) system in prophage CP4So that plays an essential role in circular CP4So maintenance after the excision in <i>Shewanella oneidensis</i>. The toxin ParE<sub>SO</sub> severely inhibits cell growth, while CopA<sub>SO</sub> functions as an antitoxin to neutralize ParE<sub>SO</sub> toxicity through direct interactions. However, the molecular mechanism of the neutralization and autoregulation of the TA operon transcription remains elusive. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of a ParE<sub>SO</sub>-CopA<sub>SO</sub> complex that adopted an open V-shaped heterotetramer with the organization of ParE<sub>SO</sub>-(CopA<sub>SO</sub>)<sub>2</sub>-ParE<sub>SO</sub>. The structure showed that upon ParE<sub>SO</sub> binding, the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of CopA<sub>SO</sub> was induced to fold into a partially ordered conformation that bound into a positively charged and hydrophobic groove of ParE<sub>SO</sub>. Thermodynamics analysis showed the DNA-binding affinity of CopA<sub>SO</sub> was remarkably higher than that of the purified TA complex, accompanied by the enthalpy change reversion from an exothermic reaction to an endothermic reaction. These results suggested ParE<sub>SO</sub> acts as a de-repressor of the TA operon transcription at the toxin:antitoxin level of 1:1. Site-directed mutagenesis of ParE<sub>SO</sub> identified His91 as the essential residue for its toxicity by cell toxicity assays. Our structure-function studies therefore elucidated the transcriptional regulation mechanism of the ParE<sub>SO</sub>-CopA<sub>SO</sub> pair, and may help to understand the regulation of CP4So maintenance in <i>S. oneidensis</i>.",

    "abstract": "Base excision repair (BER) is the main pathway protecting cells from the continuous damage to DNA inflicted by reactive oxygen species. BER is initiated by DNA glycosylases, each of which repairs a particular class of base damage. NTHL1, a bifunctional DNA glycosylase, possesses both glycolytic and \u03b2-lytic activities with a preference for oxidized pyrimidine substrates. Defects in human NTHL1 drive a class of polyposis colorectal cancer. We report the first X-ray crystal structure of hNTHL1, revealing an open conformation not previously observed in the bacterial orthologs. In this conformation, the six-helical barrel domain comprising the helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) DNA binding motif is tipped away from the iron sulphur cluster-containing domain, requiring a conformational change to assemble a catalytic site upon DNA binding. We found that the flexibility of hNTHL1 and its ability to adopt an open configuration can be attributed to an interdomain linker. Swapping the human linker sequence for that of Escherichia coli yielded a protein chimera that crystallized in a closed conformation and had a reduced activity on lesion-containing DNA. This large scale interdomain rearrangement during catalysis is unprecedented for a HhH superfamily DNA glycosylase and provides important insight into the molecular mechanism of hNTHL1.",

In mammals, BS sequences are poorly conserved, and unambiguous intron recognition cannot be achieved solely through a base-pairing mechanism. We isolated human 17<i>S</i> U2 snRNP and reconstituted in vitro its adenosine 5\u00b4-triphosphate (ATP)\u2013dependent remodeling and binding to the pre\u2013messenger RNA substrate. We determined a series of high-resolution (2.0 to 2.2 angstrom) structures providing snapshots of the BS selection process. The substrate-bound U2 snRNP shows that SF3B6 stabilizes the BS:U2 snRNA duplex, which could aid binding of introns with poor sequence complementarity. ATP-dependent remodeling uncoupled from substrate binding captures U2 snRNA in a conformation that competes with BS recognition, providing a selection mechanism based on branch helix stability.",

    "abstract": "Despite the advances in \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor development, limited options exist for the class D carbapenemase known as OXA-48. OXA-48 is one of the most prevalent carbapenemases in carbapenem-resistant <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> infections and is not susceptible to most available \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors. Here, we screened various low-molecular-weight compounds (fragments) against OXA-48 to identify functional scaffolds for inhibitor development. Several biphenyl-, naphthalene-, fluorene-, anthraquinone-, and azobenzene-based compounds were found to inhibit OXA-48 with low micromolar potency despite their small size. Co-crystal structures of OXA-48 with several of these compounds revealed key interactions with the carboxylate-binding pocket, Arg214, and various hydrophobic residues of \u03b2-lactamase that can be exploited in future inhibitor development. A number of the low-micromolar-potency inhibitors, across different scaffolds, synergize with ampicillin to kill <i>Escherichia coli</i> expressing OXA-48, albeit at high concentrations of the respective inhibitors. Additionally, several compounds demonstrated micromolar potency toward the OXA-24 and OXA-58 class D carbapenemases that are prevalent in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>. This work provides foundational information on a variety of chemical scaffolds that can guide the design of effective OXA-48 inhibitors that maintain efficacy as well as potency toward other major class D carbapenemases.",

The underlying mechanism and its coupling to ATP hydrolysis and actin binding are only partially understood, mostly due to sparse structural data on actin-bound states of myosin. Here, we report 26 high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the actomyosin-V complex in the strong-ADP, rigor, and a previously unseen post-rigor transition state that binds the ATP analog AppNHp. The structures reveal a high flexibility of myosin in each state and provide valuable insights into the structural transitions of myosin-V upon ADP release and binding of AppNHp, as well as the actomyosin interface. In addition, they show how myosin is able to specifically alter the structure of F-actin.",

The pathology associated with infection depends on bacterial delivery of effector proteins into the host via the membrane spanning Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS). We have determined sub-3.0 \u00c5 resolution maps of the Dot/Icm T4SS core complex by single particle cryo-EM. The high-resolution structural analysis has allowed us to identify proteins encoded outside the Dot/Icm genetic locus that contribute to the core T4SS structure. We can also now define two distinct areas of symmetry mismatch, one that connects the C18 periplasmic ring (PR) and the C13 outer membrane cap (OMC) and one that connects the C13 OMC with a 16-fold symmetric dome. Unexpectedly, the connection between the PR and OMC is DotH, with five copies sandwiched between the OMC and PR to accommodate the symmetry mismatch. Finally, we observe multiple conformations in the reconstructions that indicate flexibility within the structure.",

    "abstract": "Isobutene is a high value gaseous alkene used as fuel additive and a chemical building block. As an alternative to fossil fuel derived isobutene, we here develop a modified mevalonate pathway for the production of isobutene from glucose in vivo. The final step in the pathway consists of the decarboxylation of 3-methylcrotonic acid, catalysed by an evolved ferulic acid decarboxylase (Fdc) enzyme. Fdc belongs to the prFMN-dependent UbiD enzyme family that catalyses reversible decarboxylation of (hetero)aromatic acids or acrylic acids with extended conjugation. Following a screen of an Fdc library for inherent 3-methylcrotonic acid decarboxylase activity, directed evolution yields variants with up to an 80-fold increase in activity. Crystal structures of the evolved variants reveal that changes in the substrate binding pocket are responsible for increased selectivity. Solution and computational studies suggest that isobutene cycloelimination is rate limiting and strictly dependent on presence of the 3-methyl group.",

    "abstract": "Elevated intracellular levels of dNTPs have been shown to be a biochemical marker of cancer cells. Recently, a series of mutations in the multifunctional dNTP triphosphohydrolase (dNTPase), sterile alpha motif and histidine-aspartate domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), have been reported in various cancers. Here, we investigated the structure and functions of SAMHD1 R366C/H mutants, found in colon cancer and leukemia. Unlike many other cancer-specific mutations, the SAMHD1 R366 mutations do not alter cellular protein levels of the enzyme. However, R366C/H mutant proteins exhibit a loss of dNTPase activity, and their X-ray structures demonstrate the absence of dGTP substrate in their active site, likely because of a loss of interaction with the \u03b3-phosphate of the substrate. The R366C/H mutants failed to reduce intracellular dNTP levels and restrict HIV-1 replication, functions of SAMHD1 that are dependent on the ability of the enzyme to hydrolyze dNTPs. However, these mutants retain dNTPase-independent functions, including mediating dsDNA break repair, interacting with CtIP and cyclin A2, and suppressing innate immune responses. Finally, SAMHD1 degradation in human primary-activated/dividing CD4+ T cells further elevates cellular dNTP levels. This study suggests that the loss of SAMHD1 dNTPase activity induced by R366 mutations can mechanistically contribute to the elevated dNTP levels commonly found in cancer cells.",

Herein, we present a 3.3\u00a0\u00c5 resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of human SERCA2b in the E1\u00b72Ca<sup>2+</sup> state, revealing a new conformation for Ca<sup>2+</sup> -bound SERCA2b with a much closer arrangement of cytosolic domains than in the previously reported crystal structure of Ca<sup>2+</sup> -bound SERCA1a. Multiple conformations generated by 3D classification of cryo-EM maps reflect the intrinsically dynamic nature of the cytosolic domains in this state. Notably, ATP binding residues of SERCA2b in the E1\u00b72Ca<sup>2+</sup> state are located at similar positions to those in the E1\u00b72Ca<sup>2+</sup> -ATP state; hence, the cryo-EM structure likely represents a preformed state immediately prior to ATP binding. Consistently, a SERCA2b mutant with an interdomain disulfide bridge that locks the closed cytosolic domain arrangement displayed significant autophosphorylation activity in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> . We propose a novel mechanism of ATP binding to SERCA2b.",

    "abstract": "Mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), such as rotaxanes and catenanes, have captured the attention of chemists both from a synthetic perspective and because of their role as simple prototypes of molecular machines. Although examples exist in nature, most synthetic MIMs are made from artificial building blocks and assembled in organic solvents. The synthesis of MIMs from natural biomolecules remains highly challenging. Here, we report on a synthesis strategy for interlocked molecules solely made from peptides, that is, mechanically interlocked peptides (MIPs). Fully peptidic, cysteine-decorated building blocks were self-assembled in water to generate disulfide-bonded dynamic combinatorial libraries consisting of multiple different rotaxanes, catenanes and daisy chains as well as more exotic structures. Detailed NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry characterization of a [2]catenane comprising two peptide macrocycles revealed that this structure has rich conformational dynamics reminiscent of protein folding. Thus, MIPs can serve as a bridge between fully synthetic MIMs and those found in nature.",

Among the reported BRD4 inhibitors are dihydropteridinones and benzopyrimidodiazepinones originally designed to target the kinases PLK1, ERK5, and LRRK2. While these kinase inhibitors were identified as BRD4 inhibitors, little is known about their binding potential and structural details of interaction with the other BET bromodomains. We comprehensively characterized a series of known and newly identified dual BRD4-kinase inhibitors against all eight individual BET bromodomains. A detailed analysis of 23 novel cocrystal structures of BET-kinase inhibitor complexes in combination with direct binding assays and cell signaling studies revealed significant differences in molecular shape complementarity and inhibitory potential. Collectively, the data offer new insights into the action of kinase inhibitors across BET bromodomains, which may aid the development of drugs to inhibit certain BET proteins and kinases differentially.",

Reversible ADP-ribosylation has traditionally been considered a protein-specific modification<sup>5</sup>, but recent in vitro studies have suggested nucleic acids as targets<sup>6-9</sup>. Here we present evidence that specific, reversible ADP-ribosylation of DNA on thymidine bases occurs in cellulo through the DarT-DarG toxin-antitoxin system, which is found in a variety of bacteria (including global pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa)<sup>10</sup>. We report the structure of DarT, which identifies this protein as a diverged member of the PARP family. We provide a set of high-resolution structures of this enzyme in ligand-free and pre- and post-reaction states, which reveals a specialized mechanism of catalysis that includes a key active-site arginine that extends the canonical ADP-ribosyltransferase toolkit. Comparison with PARP-HPF1, a well-established DNA\u00a0repair protein ADP-ribosylation complex, offers insights into how the DarT class of ADP-ribosyltransferases evolved into specific DNA-modifying enzymes. Together, our structural and mechanistic data provide details of this PARP\u00a0family member and contribute to a fundamental understanding of the ADP-ribosylation of nucleic acids. We also show that thymine-linked ADP-ribose DNA adducts reversed by DarG antitoxin (functioning as a noncanonical DNA\u00a0repair factor) are used not only for targeted DNA damage to induce toxicity, but also as a signalling strategy for cellular processes. Using M.\u00a0tuberculosis as an exemplar, we show that DarT-DarG regulates growth by ADP-ribosylation of DNA at the origin of chromosome replication.",

    "abstract": "Between 10 and 20 million people worldwide are infected with the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Despite causing life-threatening pathologies there is no therapeutic regimen for this deltaretrovirus. Here, we screened a library of integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) candidates built around several chemical scaffolds to determine their effectiveness in limiting HTLV-1 infection. Naphthyridines with substituents in position 6 emerged as the most potent compounds against HTLV-1, with XZ450 having highest efficacy in vitro. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy we visualised XZ450 as well as the clinical HIV-1 INSTIs raltegravir and bictegravir bound to the active site of the deltaretroviral intasome. The structures reveal subtle differences in the coordination environment of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion pair involved in the interaction with the INSTIs. Our results elucidate the binding of INSTIs to the HTLV-1 intasome and support their use for pre-exposure prophylaxis and possibly future treatment of HTLV-1 infection.",

    "abstract": "Human ecto-5-nucleotidase (CD73) is involved in purinergic signalling, which influences a diverse range of biological processes. CD73 hydrolyses AMP and is the major control point for the levels of extracellular adenosine. Inhibitors of CD73 thus block the immunosuppressive action of adenosine, a promising approach for cancer immunotherapy. Interestingly, ADP and ATP are competitive inhibitors of CD73, with the most potent small-molecule inhibitors to date being non-hydrolysable ADP analogues. While AMP is the major substrate of the enzyme, CD73 has been reported to hydrolyse other 5'-nucleoside monophosphates. Based on a fragment screening campaign at the BESSY II synchrotron, we present the binding modes of various deoxyribo- and ribonucleoside monophosphates and of four additional fragments binding to the nucleoside binding site of the open form of the enzyme. Kinetic analysis of monophosphate hydrolysis shows that ribonucleotide substrates are favoured over their deoxyribose equivalents with AMP being the best substrate. We characterised the initial step of AMP hydrolysis, the binding mode of AMP to the open conformation of CD73 and compared that to other monophosphate substrates. In addition, the inhibitory activity of various bisphosphonic acid derivatives of nucleoside diphosphates was determined. Although AMPCP remains the most potent inhibitor, replacement of the adenine base with other purines or with pyrimidines increases the K<sub>i</sub> value only between twofold and sixfold. On the other hand, these nucleobases offer new opportunities to attach substituents for improved pharmacological properties.",

    "abstract": "Hearing involves two fundamental processes: mechano-electrical transduction and signal amplification. Despite decades of studies, the molecular bases for both remain elusive. Here, we show how prestin, the electromotive molecule of outer hair cells (OHCs) that senses both voltage and membrane tension, mediates signal amplification by coupling conformational changes to alterations in membrane surface area. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human prestin bound with chloride or salicylate at a common \"anion site\" adopt contracted or expanded states, respectively. Prestin is ensconced within a perimeter of well-ordered lipids, through which it induces dramatic deformation in the membrane and couples protein conformational changes to the bulk membrane. Together with computational studies, we illustrate how the anion site is allosterically coupled to changes in the transmembrane domain cross-sectional area and the surrounding membrane. These studies provide insight into OHC electromotility by providing a structure-based mechanism of the membrane motor prestin.",

However, the mechanism that MmpL3 uses to facilitate the transport of fatty acids and lipidic elements to the mycobacterial cell wall remains elusive. Here, we report 7 structures of the M. smegmatis MmpL3 transporter in its unbound state and in complex with trehalose 6-decanoate (T6D) or TMM using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography. Combined with calculated results from molecular dynamics (MD) and target MD simulations, we reveal a lipid transport mechanism that involves a coupled movement of the periplasmic domain and transmembrane helices of the MmpL3 transporter that facilitates the shuttling of lipids to the mycobacterial cell wall.",

In this study, we used rhesus macaques to evaluate the immunogenicity of several stabilized BG505 SOSIP constructs both as free trimers and presented on a nanoparticle. We applied a cryoEM-based method for high-resolution mapping of polyclonal antibody responses elicited in immunized animals (cryoEMPEM). Mutational analysis coupled with neutralization assays were used to probe the neutralization potential at each epitope. We demonstrate that cryoEMPEM data can be used for rapid, high-resolution analysis of polyclonal antibody responses without the need for monoclonal antibody isolation. This approach allowed to resolve structurally distinct classes of antibodies that bind overlapping sites. In addition to comprehensive mapping of commonly targeted neutralizing and non-neutralizing epitopes in BG505 SOSIP immunogens, our analysis revealed that epitopes comprising engineered stabilizing mutations and of partially occupied glycosylation sites can be immunogenic.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic cells invoke breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA2) to repair programmed double-stranded DNA breaks and accomplish homologous recombination. The meiosis-specific protein MEILB2 facilitates BRCA2 recruitment to meiotic recombination sites. Here, we combine crystallography, biochemical analysis and a mouse meiosis model to reveal a robust architecture that ensures meiotic BRCA2 recruitment. The crystal structure of the MEILB2-BRCA2 complex reveals how two MEILB2 homodimers sandwich two chains of BRCA2 to afford a 4:2 architecture. The sandwich lacks close contact between the two MEILB2 dimers or the two BRCA2 chains. Instead, the two halves of each BRCA2 chain bridge two MEILB2 subunits from different homodimers to form the MEILB2-BRCA2-MEILB2 sandwich. Several identical residues from the two MEILB2 subunits are employed to engage the BRCA2 halves, justifying their strict conservation. Mutational analysis of the interface reveals a synergistic mechanism for MEILB2-BRCA2 recruitment during meiosis. Overall, these studies demonstrate how BRCA2 efficiently localizes in the cell to facilitate meiosis.",

Here we describe the chemical synthesis and polymerase recognition of 10 chemically diverse functional groups introduced at the C-5 position of \u03b1-l-threofuranosyl uridine nucleoside triphosphate (tUTP). We show that the set of tUTP substrates is universally recognized by the laboratory-evolved polymerase Kod-RSGA.

A structural analysis reveals a large cavity in the enzyme active site that can accommodate the side chain of C-5-modified tUTP substrates. Our findings expand the chemical space of evolvable nucleic acid systems by providing a synthetic route to artificial genetic polymers that are uniformly modified with diversity-enhancing functional groups.",

    "abstract": "Efforts to improve estrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER)-targeted therapies in breast cancer have relied upon a single mechanism, with ligands having a single side chain on the ligand core that extends outward to determine antagonism of breast cancer growth. Here, we describe inhibitors with two ER-targeting moieties, one of which uses an alternate structural mechanism to generate full antagonism, freeing the side chain to independently determine other critical properties of the ligands. By combining two molecular targeting approaches into a single ER ligand, we have generated antiestrogens that function through new mechanisms and structural paradigms to achieve antagonism. These dual-mechanism ER inhibitors (DMERIs) cause alternate, noncanonical structural perturbations of the receptor ligand-binding domain (LBD) to antagonize proliferation in ER-positive breast cancer cells and in allele-specific resistance models. Our structural analyses with DMERIs highlight marked differences from current standard-of-care, single-mechanism antiestrogens. These findings uncover an enhanced flexibility of the ER LBD through which it can access nonconsensus conformational modes in response to DMERI binding, broadly and effectively suppressing ER activity.",

    "abstract": "Activation of enzymes by monovalent cations (M+) is a widespread phenomenon in biology. Despite this, there are few structure-based studies describing the underlying molecular details. Thiolases are a ubiquitous and highly conserved family of enzymes containing both K+-activated and K+-independent members. Guided by structures of naturally occurring K+-activated thiolases, we have used a structure-based approach to engineer K+-activation into a K+-independent thiolase. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of engineering K+-activation into an enzyme, showing the malleability of proteins to accommodate M+ ions as allosteric regulators. We show that a few protein structural features encode K+-activation in this class of enzyme. Specifically, two residues near the substrate-binding site are sufficient for K+-activation: A tyrosine residue is required to complete the K+ coordination sphere, and a glutamate residue provides a compensating charge for the bound K+ ion. Further to these, a distal residue is important for positioning a K+-coordinating water molecule that forms a direct hydrogen bond to the substrate. The stability of a cation-\u03c0 interaction between a positively charged residue and the substrate is determined by the conformation of the loop surrounding the substrate-binding site. Our results suggest that this cation-\u03c0 interaction effectively overrides K+-activation, and is, therefore, destabilised in K+-activated thiolases. Evolutionary conservation of these amino acids provides a promising signature sequence for predicting K+-activation in thiolases. Together, our structural, biochemical and bioinformatic work provide important mechanistic insights into how enzymes can be allosterically activated by M+ ions.",

Little is known about their function and the architectural transitions of the pre-ribosomal intermediates. Here, we solve cryo-EM structures of the human 39S large subunit pre-ribosomes, representing five distinct late states. Besides the MALSU1 complex used as bait for affinity purification, we identify several assembly factors, including the DDX28 helicase, MRM3, GTPBP10 and the NSUN4-mTERF4 complex, all of which keep the 16S rRNA in immature conformations. The late transitions mainly involve rRNA domains IV and V, which form the central protuberance, the intersubunit side and the peptidyltransferase center of the 39S subunit. Unexpectedly, we find deacylated tRNA in the ribosomal E-site, suggesting a role in 39S assembly. Taken together, our study provides an architectural inventory of the distinct late assembly phase of the human 39S mitoribosome.",

However, there are only a limited number of topologically distinct DRP folds in nature, and most of them suffer from the problem of <i>in vitro</i> oxidative folding. Thus, strategies to design DRPs with new constrained topologies beyond the scope of natural folds are desired. Herein we report a general evolution-inspired strategy to design new DRPs with diverse disulfide frameworks, which relies on the incorporation of two cysteine residues and a random peptide sequence into a precursor disulfide-stabilized fold. These peptides can spontaneously fold in redox buffers to the expected tricyclic topologies with high yields. Moreover, we demonstrated that these DRPs can be used as templates for the construction of phage-displayed peptide libraries, enabling the discovery of new DRP ligands from fully randomized sequences. This study thus paves the way for the development of new DRP ligands and therapeutics with structures not derived from natural DRPs.",

    "abstract": "Attachment of sugars to nitrogen and oxygen in peptides is ubiquitous in biology, but glycosylation of sulfur atoms has only been recently described. Here, we characterize two S-glycosyltransferases SunS and ThuS that selectively glycosylate one of five Cys residues in their substrate peptides; substitution of this Cys with Ser results in a strong decrease in glycosylation activity. Crystal structures of SunS and ThuS in complex with UDP-glucose or a derivative reveal an unusual architecture in which a glycosyltransferase type A (GTA) fold is decorated with additional domains to support homodimerization. Dimer formation creates an extended cavity for the substrate peptide, drawing functional analogy with O-glycosyltransferases involved in cell wall biosynthesis. This extended cavity contains a sharp bend that may explain the site selectivity of the glycosylation because the target Cys is in a Gly-rich stretch that can accommodate the bend. These studies establish a molecular framework for understanding the unusual S-glycosyltransferases.",

    "abstract": "The vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (VAO) family is a rich source of biocatalysts for the oxidative bioconversion of phenolic compounds. Through genome mining and sequence comparisons, we found that several family members lack a generally conserved catalytic aspartate. This finding led us to study a VAO-homolog featuring a glutamate residue in place of the common aspartate. This 4-ethylphenol oxidase from Gulosibacter chungangensis (Gc4EO) shares 42\u2009% sequence identity with VAO from Penicillium simplicissimum, contains the same 8\u03b1-N<sup>3</sup> -histidyl-bound FAD and uses oxygen as electron acceptor. However, Gc4EO features a distinct substrate scope and product specificity as it is primarily effective in the dehydrogenation of para-substituted phenols with little generation of hydroxylated products. The three-dimensional structure shows that the characteristic glutamate side chain creates a closely packed environment that may limit water accessibility and thereby protect from hydroxylation. With its high thermal stability, well defined structural properties and high expression yields, Gc4EO may become a catalyst of choice for the specific dehydrogenation of phenolic compounds bearing small substituents.",

    "abstract": "Novel antimicrobial strategies are urgently required because of the rising threat of multi drug resistant bacterial strains and the infections caused by them. Among the available target structures, the so-called penicillin binding proteins are of particular interest, owing to their good accessibility in the periplasmic space, and the lack of homologous proteins in humans, reducing the risk of side effects of potential drugs. In this report, we focus on the interaction of the innovative \u03b2-lactam antibiotic AIC499 with penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP3) from <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. This recently developed monobactam displays broad antimicrobial activity, against Gram-negative strains, and improved resistance to most classes of \u03b2-lactamases. By analyzing crystal structures of the respective complexes, we were able to explore the binding mode of AIC499 to its target proteins. In addition, the apo structures determined for PBP3, from <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and the catalytic transpeptidase domain of the <i>E. coli</i> orthologue, provide new insights into the dynamics of these proteins and the impact of drug binding.",

    "abstract": "The heteropolysaccharide xylan is a valuable source of sustainable chemicals and materials from renewable biomass sources. A complete hydrolysis of this major hemicellulose component requires a diverse set of enzymes including endo-\u03b2-1,4-xylanases, \u03b2-xylosidases, acetylxylan esterases, \u03b1-l-arabinofuranosidases, and \u03b1-glucuronidases. Notably, the most studied xylanases from glycoside hydrolase family 11 (GH11) have exclusively been endo-\u03b2-1,4- and \u03b2-1,3-xylanases. However, a recent analysis of a metatranscriptome library from a microbial lignocellulose community revealed GH11 enzymes capable of releasing solely xylobiose from xylan. Although initial biochemical studies clearly indicated their xylobiohydrolase mode of action, the structural features that drive this new activity still remained unclear. It was also not clear whether the enzymes acted on the reducing or nonreducing end of the substrate. Here, we solved the crystal structure of MetXyn11 in the apo and xylobiose-bound forms. The structure of MetXyn11 revealed the molecular features that explain the observed pattern on xylooligosaccharides released by this nonreducing end xylobiohydrolase.",

These proteins are structurally idiosyncratic, and thus the permeation pathway and mechanism have no analogy in other known ion channels. Although fluoride-binding sites were identified in previous structural studies, it was not evident how these ions access aqueous solution, and the molecular determinants of anion recognition and selectivity have not been elucidated. Using x-ray crystallography, planar bilayer electrophysiology, and liposome-based assays, we identified additional binding sites along the permeation pathway. We used this information to develop an oriented system for planar lipid bilayer electrophysiology and observed anion block at one of these sites, revealing insights into the mechanism of anion recognition. We propose a permeation mechanism involving alternating occupancy of anion-binding sites that are fully assembled only as the substrate approaches.",

    "abstract": "The incredible potential for fluorescent proteins to revolutionize biology has inspired the development of a variety of design strategies to address an equally broad range of photophysical characteristics, depending on potential applications. Of these, fluorescent proteins that simultaneously exhibit high quantum yield, red-shifted emission, and wide separation between excitation and emission wavelengths (Large Stokes Shift, LSS) are rare. The pursuit of LSS systems has led to the formation of a complex, obtained from the marriage of a rationally engineered protein (human cellular retinol binding protein II, hCRBPII) and different fluorogenic molecules, capable of supporting photobase activity. The large increase in basicity upon photoexcitation leads to protonation of the fluorophore in the excited state, dramatically red-shifting its emission, leading to an LSS protein/fluorophore complex. Essential for selective photobase activity is the intimate involvement of the target protein structure and sequence that enables Excited State Proton Transfer (ESPT). The potential power and usefulness of the strategy was demonstrated in live cell imaging of human cell lines.",

Herein, we present a series of near-atomic-resolution X-ray crystal structures of the adducts formed between the antimetastatic metallodrug imidazolium <i>trans</i>-[tetrachlorido(<i>S</i>-dimethyl sufoxide)(1<i>H</i>-imidazole)ruthenate(III)] (<b>NAMI-A</b>) and hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL). These structures elucidate a series of binding events starting from the noncovalent interaction of intact <b>NAMI-A</b> ions with HEWL (1.5 h), followed by the stepwise exchange of all Ru ligands except for 1<i>H</i>-imidazole (26 h) to the final \"ruthenated\" protein comprising one aquated Ru ion coordinated to histidine-15 of HEWL (98 h). Our structural data clearly support a two-step mechanism of protein ruthenation, illustrating the ligand-mediated recognition step of the process.",

Here, we report a gallery of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the human GluN1-GluN2A NMDA receptor at an overall resolution of 4\u00a0\u00c5 in complex with distinct ligands or modulators. In the full-length context of GluN1-GluN2A receptors, we visualize the competitive antagonists bound to the ligand-binding domains (LBDs) of GluN1 and GluN2A subunits, respectively. We reveal that the binding of positive allosteric modulator shortens the distance between LBDs and the transmembrane domain (TMD), which further stretches the opening of the gate. In addition, we unexpectedly visualize the binding cavity of the \"foot-in-the-door\" blocker 9-aminoacridine within the LBD-TMD linker region, differing from the conventional \"trapping\" blocker binding site at the vestibule within the TMD. Our study provides molecular insights into the crosstalk between LBDs and TMD during channel activation, inhibition, and allosteric transition.",

    "abstract": "PIWI proteins use PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) to identify and silence transposable elements and thereby maintain genome integrity between metazoan generations<sup>1</sup>. The targeting of transposable elements by PIWI has been compared to mRNA target recognition by Argonaute proteins<sup>2,3</sup>, which use microRNA (miRNA) guides, but the extent to which piRNAs resemble miRNAs is not known. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of a PIWI-piRNA complex from the sponge Ephydatia fluviatilis with and without target RNAs, and a biochemical analysis of target recognition. Mirroring Argonaute, PIWI identifies targets using the piRNA seed region. However, PIWI creates a much weaker seed so that stable target association requires further piRNA-target pairing, making piRNAs less promiscuous than miRNAs. Beyond the seed, the structure of PIWI facilitates piRNA-target pairing in a manner that is tolerant of mismatches, leading to long-lived PIWI-piRNA-target interactions that may accumulate on transposable-element transcripts. PIWI ensures targeting fidelity by physically blocking the propagation of piRNA-target interactions in the absence of faithful seed pairing, and by requiring an extended piRNA-target duplex to reach an endonucleolytically active conformation. PIWI proteins thereby minimize off-targeting cellular mRNAs while defending against evolving genomic threats.",

The biosynthesis of these compounds is well characterized, with the exception of the standalone \u03b2-ketoreductase enzyme AntM that is proposed to catalyze the reduction of the C8 carbonyl of the antimycin scaffold. Inactivation of <i>antM</i> and structural characterization suggested that rather than functioning as a post-PKS tailoring enzyme, AntM acts upon the terminal biosynthetic intermediate while it is tethered to the PKS acyl carrier protein. Mutational analysis identified two amino acid residues (Tyr185 and Phe223) that are proposed to serve as checkpoints controlling substrate access to the AntM active site. Aromatic checkpoint residues are conserved in uncharacterized standalone \u03b2-ketoreductases, indicating that they may also act concomitantly with synthesis of the scaffold. These data provide novel mechanistic insights into the functionality of standalone \u03b2-ketoreductases and will enable their reprogramming for combinatorial biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Two paralogs of the guanine dissociation inhibitor-like solubilizing factors UNC119, UNC119A and UNC119B, are present in the human genome. UNC119 binds to N-myristoylated proteins and masks the hydrophobic lipid from the hydrophilic cytosol, facilitating trafficking between different membranes. Two classes of UNC119 cargo proteins have been classified: low affinity cargoes, released by the Arf-like proteins ARL2 and ARL3, and high affinity cargoes, which are specifically released by ARL3 and trafficked to either the primary cilium or the immunological synapse. The UNC119 homologues have reported differences in functionality, but the structural and biochemical bases for these differences are unknown. Using myristoylated peptide binding and release assays, we show that peptides sharing the previously identified UNC119A high affinity motif show significant variations of binding affinities to UNC119B of up to 427-fold. Furthermore, we solve the first two crystal structures of UNC119B, one in complex with the high affinity cargo peptide of LCK and a second one in complex with the release factor ARL3. Using these novel structures, we identify a stretch of negatively charged amino acids unique to UNC119B that may undergo a conformational change following binding of a release factor which we propose as an additional release mechanism specific to UNC119B.",

Here, we elucidate the structural and mechanistic basis of fluorescence activation by crystallography and time-resolved optical spectroscopy. Two co-crystal structures of the Chili RNA with positively charged DMHBO<sup>+</sup> and DMHBI<sup>+</sup> ligands revealed a G-quadruplex and a trans-sugar-sugar edge G:G base pair that immobilize the ligand by \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking. A Watson-Crick G:C base pair in the fluorophore binding site establishes a short hydrogen bond between the N7 of guanine and the phenolic OH of the ligand. Ultrafast excited state proton transfer (ESPT) from the neutral chromophore to the RNA was found with a time constant of 130\u2009fs and revealed the mode of action of the large Stokes shift fluorogenic RNA aptamer.",

    "abstract": "Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, Covid-19 has developed into a serious threat to our health, social and economic systems. Although vaccines have been developed in a tour-de-force and are now increasingly available, repurposing of existing drugs has been less successful. There is a clear need to develop new drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that can also be used against future coronavirus infections. Non-structural protein 10 (nsp10) is a conserved stimulator of two enzymes crucial for viral replication, nsp14 and nsp16, exhibiting exoribonuclease and methyltransferase activities. Interfering with RNA proofreading or RNA cap formation represents intervention strategies to inhibit replication. We applied fragment-based screening using nano differential scanning fluorometry and X-ray crystallography to identify ligands targeting SARS-CoV-2 nsp10. We identified four fragments located in two distinct sites: one can be modelled to where it would be located in the nsp14-nsp10 complex interface and the other in the nsp16-nsp10 complex interface. Microscale thermophoresis (MST) experiments were used to quantify fragment affinities for nsp10. Additionally, we showed by MST that the interaction by nsp14 and 10 is weak and thereby that complex formation could be disrupted by small molecules. The fragments will serve as starting points for the development of more potent analogues using fragment growing techniques and structure-based drug design.",

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation in the outermost layers of the cornea, which can lead to cloudy vision and in severe cases blindness, is linked to mutations in the extracellular matrix protein transforming growth factor-\u03b2-induced protein (TGFBIp). Among the most frequent pathogenic mutations are R124H and R555W, both associated with granular corneal dystrophy (GCD) characterized by the early-onset formation of amorphous aggregates. The molecular mechanisms of protein aggregation in GCD are largely unknown. In this study, we determined the crystal structures of R124H, R555W, and the lattice corneal dystrophy-associated A546T. Although there were no changes in the monomeric TGFBIp structure of any mutant that would explain their propensity to aggregate, R124H and R555W demonstrated a new dimer interface in the crystal packing, which is not present in wildtype TGFBIp or A546T. This interface, as seen in both the R124H and R555W structures, involves residue 124 of the first TGFBIp molecule and 555 in the second. The interface is not permitted by the Arg124 and Arg555 residues of wildtype TGFBIp and may play a central role in the aggregation exhibited by R124H and R555W in\u00a0vivo. Using cross-linking mass spectrometry and in-line size exclusion chromatography-small-angle X-ray scattering, we characterized a dimer formed by wildtype and mutant TGFBIps in solution. Dimerization in solution also involves interactions between the N- and C-terminal domains of two TGFBIp molecules but was not identical to the crystal packing dimerization. TGFBIp-targeted interventions that disrupt the R124H/R555W crystal packing dimer interface might offer new therapeutic opportunities to treat patients with GCD.",

    "abstract": "While a structural description of the molecular mechanisms guiding ribosome assembly in eukaryotic systems is emerging, bacteria use an unrelated core set of assembly factors for which high-resolution structural information is still missing. To address this, we used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to visualize the effects of bacterial ribosome assembly factors RimP, RbfA, RsmA, and RsgA on the conformational landscape of the 30<i>S</i> ribosomal subunit and obtained eight snapshots representing late steps in the folding of the decoding center. Analysis of these structures identifies a conserved secondary structure switch in the 16<i>S</i> ribosomal RNA central to decoding site maturation and suggests both a sequential order of action and molecular mechanisms for the assembly factors in coordinating and controlling this switch. Structural and mechanistic parallels between bacterial and eukaryotic systems indicate common folding features inherent to all ribosomes.",

    "abstract": "Ricin toxin kills mammalian cells with notorious efficiency. The toxin's B subunit (RTB) is a Gal/GalNAc-specific lectin that attaches to cell surfaces and promotes retrograde transport of ricin's A subunit (RTA) to the trans Golgi network (TGN) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). RTA is liberated from RTB in the ER and translocated into the cell cytoplasm, where it functions as a ribosome-inactivating protein. While antibodies against ricin's individual subunits have been reported, we now describe seven alpaca-derived, single-domain antibodies (V<sub>H</sub>Hs) that span the RTA-RTB interface, including four Tier 1 V<sub>H</sub>Hs with IC<sub>50</sub> values <1\u00a0nM. Crystal structures of each V<sub>H</sub>H bound to native ricin holotoxin revealed three different binding modes, based on contact with RTA's F-G loop (mode 1), RTB's subdomain 2\u03b3 (mode 2) or both (mode 3). V<sub>H</sub>Hs in modes 2 and 3 were highly effective at blocking ricin attachment to HeLa cells and immobilized asialofetuin, due to framework residues (FR3) that occupied the 2\u03b3 Gal/GalNAc-binding pocket and mimic ligand. The four Tier 1 V<sub>H</sub>Hs also interfered with intracellular functions of RTB, as they neutralized ricin in a post-attachment cytotoxicity assay (e.g., the toxin was bound to cell surfaces before antibody addition) and reduced the efficiency of toxin transport to the TGN. We conclude that the RTA-RTB interface is a target of potent toxin-neutralizing antibodies that interfere with both extracellular and intracellular events in ricin's cytotoxic pathway.",

While significant progress has been gained in developing protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitors, the orthogonal approach of PPI stabilization lacks established methodologies for drug design. Here, we report the systematic \u2033bottom-up\u2033 development of a reversible covalent PPI stabilizer. An imine bond was employed to anchor the stabilizer at the interface of the 14-3-3/p65 complex, leading to a molecular glue that elicited an 81-fold increase in complex stabilization. Utilizing protein crystallography and biophysical assays, we deconvoluted how chemical properties of a stabilizer translate to structural changes in the ternary 14-3-3/p65/molecular glue complex. Furthermore, we explore how this leads to high cooperativity and increased stability of the complex.",

    "abstract": "DNA synthesis by polymerases is essential for life. Deprotonation of the nucleophile 3'-OH is thought to be the obligatory first step in the DNA synthesis reaction. We have examined each entity surrounding the nucleophile 3'-OH in the reaction catalyzed by human DNA polymerase (Pol) \u03b7 and delineated the deprotonation process by combining mutagenesis with steady-state kinetics, high-resolution structures of in crystallo reactions, and molecular dynamics simulations. The conserved S113 residue, which forms a hydrogen bond with the primer 3'-OH in the ground state, stabilizes the primer end in the active site. Mutation of S113 to alanine destabilizes primer binding and reduces the catalytic efficiency. Displacement of a water molecule that is hydrogen bonded to the 3'-OH using the 2'-OH of a ribonucleotide or 2'-F has little effect on catalysis. Moreover, combining the S113A mutation with 2'-F replacement, which removes two potential hydrogen acceptors of the 3'-OH, does not reduce the catalytic efficiency. We conclude that the proton can leave the O3' via alternative paths, supporting the hypothesis that binding of the third Mg<sup>2+</sup> initiates the reaction by breaking the \u03b1-\u03b2 phosphodiester bond of an incoming deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP).",

    "abstract": "In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the glyoxylate cycle is controlled through the posttranslational regulation of its component enzymes, such as isocitrate lyase (ICL), which catalyzes the first unique step of the cycle. The ICL of S.cerevisiae (ScIcl1) is tagged for proteasomal degradation through ubiquitination by a multisubunit ubiquitin ligase (the glucose-induced degradation-deficient (GID) complex), whereas that of the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans (CaIcl1) escapes this process. However, the reason for the ubiquitin targeting specificity of the GID complex for ScIcl1 and not for CaIcl1 is unclear. To gain some insight into this, in this study, the crystal structures of apo ScIcl1 and CaIcl1 in complex with formate and the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of apo CaIcl1 were determined at a resolution of 2.3, 2.7, and 2.6\u00a0\u00c5, respectively. A comparison of the various structures suggests that the orientation of N-terminal helix \u03b11 in S.cerevisiae is likely key to repositioning of ubiquitination sites and contributes to the distinction found in C. albicans ubiquitin evasion mechanism. This finding gives us a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of ubiquitin-dependent ScIcl1 degradation and could serve as a theoretical basis for the research and development of anti-C. albicans drugs based on the concept of CaIcl1 ubiquitination.",

    "abstract": "CYTH proteins make up a large superfamily that is conserved in all three domains of life. These enzymes have a triphosphate tunnel metalloenzyme (TTM) fold, which typically results in phosphatase functions, e.g., RNA triphosphatase, inorganic polyphosphatase, or thiamine triphosphatase. Some CYTH orthologs cyclize nucleotide triphosphates to 3',5'-cyclic nucleotides. So far, archaeal CYTH proteins have been annotated as adenylyl cyclases, although experimental evidence to support these annotations is lacking. To address this gap, we characterized a CYTH ortholog, SaTTM, from the crenarchaeote Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. Our in silico studies derived ten major subclasses within the CYTH family implying a close relationship between these archaeal CYTH enzymes and class IV adenylyl cyclases. However, initial biochemical characterization reveals inability of SaTTM to produce any cyclic nucleotides. Instead, our structural and functional analyses show a classical TTM behavior, i.e., triphosphatase activity, where pyrophosphate causes product inhibition. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-inhibited Michaelis complex indicates a two-metal-ion reaction mechanism analogous to other TTMs. Cocrystal structures of SaTTM further reveal conformational dynamics in SaTTM that suggest feedback inhibition in TTMs due to tunnel closure in the product state. These structural insights combined with further sequence similarity network-based in silico analyses provide a firm molecular basis for distinguishing CYTH orthologs with phosphatase activities from class IV adenylyl cyclases.",

    "abstract": "The inhibition of the nuclear receptor retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptor \u03b3t (ROR\u03b3t) is a promising strategy in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. ROR\u03b3t features an allosteric binding site within its ligand-binding domain that provides an opportunity to overcome drawbacks associated with orthosteric modulators. Recently, trisubstituted isoxazoles were identified as a novel class of allosteric ROR\u03b3t inverse agonists. This chemotype offers new opportunities for optimization into selective and efficacious allosteric drug-like molecules. Here, we explore the structure-activity relationship profile of the isoxazole series utilizing a combination of structure-based design, X-ray crystallography, and biochemical assays. The initial lead isoxazole (<b>FM26</b>) was optimized, resulting in compounds with a \u223c10-fold increase in potency (low nM), significant cellular activity, promising pharmacokinetic properties, and a good selectivity profile over the peroxisome-proliferated-activated receptor \u03b3 and the farnesoid X receptor. We envisage that this work will serve as a platform for the accelerated development of isoxazoles and other novel chemotypes for the effective allosteric targeting of ROR\u03b3t.",

    "abstract": "Fixed-target serial crystallography has become an important method for the study of protein structure and dynamics at synchrotrons and X-ray free-electron lasers. However, sample homogeneity, consumption and the physical stress on samples remain major challenges for these high-throughput experiments, which depend on high-quality protein microcrystals. The batch crystallization procedures that are typically applied require time- and sample-intensive screening and optimization. Here, a simple protein crystallization method inside the features of the HARE serial crystallography chips is reported that circumvents batch crystallization and allows the direct transfer of canonical vapor-diffusion conditions to in-chip crystallization. Based on conventional hanging-drop vapor-diffusion experiments, the crystallization solution is distributed into the wells of the HARE chip and equilibrated against a reservoir with mother liquor. Using this simple method, high-quality microcrystals were generated with sufficient density for the structure determination of four different proteins. A new protein variant was crystallized using the protein concentrations encountered during canonical crystallization experiments, enabling structure determination from \u223c55\u2005\u00b5g of protein. Additionally, structure determination from intracellular crystals grown in insect cells cultured directly in the features of the HARE chips is demonstrated. In cellulo crystallization represents a comparatively unexplored space in crystallization, especially for proteins that are resistant to crystallization using conventional techniques, and eliminates any need for laborious protein purification. This in-chip technique avoids harvesting the sensitive crystals or any further physical handling of the crystal-containing cells. These proof-of-principle experiments indicate the potential of this method to become a simple alternative to batch crystallization approaches and also as a convenient extension to canonical crystallization screens.",

    "abstract": "Glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) usually detoxify xenobiotics. The human pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus however uses the exceptional GST GliG to incorporate two sulfur atoms into its virulence factor gliotoxin. Because these sulfurs are essential for biological activity, glutathionylation is a key step of gliotoxin biosynthesis. Yet, the mechanism of carbon-sulfur linkage formation from a bis-hydroxylated precursor is unresolved. Here, we report structures of GliG with glutathione (GSH) and its reaction product cyclo[-l-Phe-l-Ser]-bis-glutathione, which has been purified from a genetically modified A. fumigatus strain. The structures argue for stepwise processing of first the Phe and second the Ser moiety. Enzyme-mediated dehydration of the substrate activates GSH and a helix dipole stabilizes the resulting anion via a water molecule for the nucleophilic attack. Activity assays with mutants validate the interactions of GliG with the ligands and enrich our knowledge about enzymatic C-S bond formation in gliotoxin and epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) natural compounds in general.",

Here, we describe an approach for encoding this challenge-the inhibition of a human drug target-into a microbial host and using it to guide the discovery and biosynthesis of targeted, biologically active natural products. This approach identified two previously unknown terpenoid inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), an elusive therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes and cancer. Both inhibitors appear to target an allosteric site, which confers selectivity, and can inhibit PTP1B in living cells. A screen of 24 uncharacterized terpene synthases from a pool of 4464 genes uncovered additional hits, demonstrating a scalable discovery approach, and the incorporation of different PTPs into the microbial host yielded alternative PTP-specific detection systems. Findings illustrate the potential for using microbes to discover and build natural products that exhibit precisely defined biochemical activities yet possess unanticipated structures and/or binding sites.",

    "abstract": "We optimized lipidomics methods to broadly detect endogenous lipids bound to cellular CD1a proteins. Whereas membrane phospholipids dominate in cells, CD1a preferentially captured sphingolipids, especially a C42, doubly unsaturated sphingomyelin (42:2 SM). The natural 42:2 SM but not the more common 34:1 SM blocked CD1a tetramer binding to T cells in all human subjects tested. Thus, cellular CD1a selectively captures a particular endogenous lipid that broadly blocks its binding to TCRs. Crystal structures show that the short cellular SMs stabilized a triad of surface residues to remain flush with CD1a, but the longer lipids forced the phosphocholine group to ride above the display platform to hinder TCR approach. Whereas nearly all models emphasize antigen-mediated T cell activation, we propose that the CD1a system has intrinsic autoreactivity and is negatively regulated by natural endogenous inhibitors selectively bound in its cleft. Further, the detailed chemical structures of natural blockers could guide future design of therapeutic blockers of CD1a response.",

    "abstract": "Tubulin plays essential roles in vital cellular activities and is the target of a wide range of proteins and ligands. Here, using a combined computational and crystallographic fragment screening approach, we addressed the question of how many binding sites exist in tubulin. We identified 27 distinct sites, of which 11 have not been described previously, and analyzed their relationship to known tubulin-protein and tubulin-ligand interactions. We further observed an intricate pocket communication network and identified 56 chemically diverse fragments that bound to 10 distinct tubulin sites. Our results offer a unique structural basis for the development of novel small molecules for use as tubulin modulators in basic research applications or as drugs. Furthermore, our method lays down a framework that may help to discover new pockets in other pharmaceutically important targets and characterize them in terms of chemical tractability and allosteric modulation.",

    "abstract": "The mRNA cap-binding protein, eIF4E, mediates the recognition of the mRNA 5' end and, as part of the heterotrimeric eIF4F complex, facilitates the recruitment of the ribosomal subunits to initiate eukaryotic translation. Various regulatory events involving eIF4E and a second eIF4F subunit, eIF4G, are required for proper control of translation initiation. In pathogenic trypanosomatids, six eIF4Es and five eIF4Gs have been described, several forming different eIF4F-like complexes with yet unresolved roles. EIF4E5 is one of the least known of the trypanosomatid eIF4Es and has not been characterized in <i>Leishmania</i> species. Here, we used immunoprecipitation assays, combined with mass-spectrometry, to identify major EIF4E5 interacting proteins in <i>L. infantum</i>. A constitutively expressed, HA-tagged, EIF4E5 co-precipitated mainly with EIF4G1 and binding partners previously described in <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>, EIF4G1-IP, RBP43 and the 14-3-3 proteins. In contrast, no clear co-precipitation with EIF4G2, also previously reported, was observed. EIF4E5 also co-precipitated with protein kinases, possibly associated with cell-cycle regulation, selected RNA binding proteins and histones. Phosphorylated residues were identified and mapped to the <i>Leishmania</i>-specific C-terminal end. Mutagenesis of the tryptophan residue (W53) postulated to mediate interactions with protein partners or of a neighbouring tryptophan conserved in <i>Leishmania</i> (W45) did not substantially impair the identified interactions. Finally, the crystal structure of <i>Leishmania</i> EIF4E5 evidences remarkable differences in the eIF4G interfacing region, when compared with human eIF4E-1 and with its <i>Trypanosoma</i> orthologue. Mapping of its C-terminal end near the cap-binding site also imply relevant differences in cap-binding function and/or regulation.",

A drug that kinetically stabilizes LCs could suppress aggregation; however, LC sequences are variable and have no natural ligands, hindering drug development efforts. We previously identified high-throughput screening hits that bind to a site at the interface between the two variable domains of the LC homodimer. We hypothesized that extending the stabilizers beyond this initially characterized binding site would improve affinity. Here, using protease sensitivity assays, we identified stabilizers that can be divided into four substructures. Some stabilizers exhibit nanomolar EC<sub>50</sub> values, a 3000-fold enhancement over the screening hits. Crystal structures reveal a key \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction with a conserved tyrosine residue that was not utilized by the screening hits. These data provide a foundation for developing LC stabilizers with improved binding selectivity and enhanced physicochemical properties.",

    "abstract": "The initiation of transcription is a focal point for the regulation of gene activity during mammalian cell differentiation and development. To initiate transcription, RNA polymerase II (Pol\u00a0II) assembles with general transcription factors into a pre-initiation complex (PIC) that opens promoter DNA. Previous work provided the molecular architecture of the yeast<sup>1-9</sup> and human<sup>10,11</sup> PIC and a topological model for DNA opening by the general transcription factor TFIIH<sup>12-14</sup>. Here we report the high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of PIC comprising human general factors and Sus scrofa domesticus Pol\u00a0II, which is 99.9% identical to human Pol\u00a0II. We determine the structures of PIC with closed and opened promoter DNA at 2.5-2.8\u00a0\u00c5 resolution, and resolve the structure of TFIIH at 2.9-4.0\u00a0\u00c5 resolution. We capture the TFIIH translocase XPB in the pre- and post-translocation states, and show that XPB induces and propagates a DNA twist to initiate the opening of DNA approximately 30 base pairs downstream of the TATA box. We also provide evidence that DNA opening occurs in two steps and leads to the detachment of TFIIH from the core PIC, which may stop DNA twisting and enable RNA chain initiation.",

    "abstract": "How are E3 ubiquitin ligases configured to match substrate quaternary structures? Here, by studying the yeast GID complex (mutation of which causes deficiency in glucose-induced degradation of gluconeogenic enzymes), we discover supramolecular chelate assembly as an E3 ligase strategy for targeting an oligomeric substrate. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures show that, to bind the tetrameric substrate fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Fbp1), two minimally functional GID E3s assemble into the 20-protein Chelator-GID<sup>SR4</sup>, which resembles an organometallic supramolecular chelate. The Chelator-GID<sup>SR4</sup> assembly avidly binds multiple Fbp1 degrons so that multiple Fbp1 protomers are simultaneously ubiquitylated at lysines near the allosteric and substrate binding sites. Importantly, key structural and biochemical features, including capacity for supramolecular assembly, are preserved in the human ortholog, the CTLH E3. Based on our integrative structural, biochemical, and cell biological data, we propose that higher-order E3 ligase assembly generally enables multipronged targeting, capable of simultaneously incapacitating multiple protomers and functionalities of oligomeric substrates.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial flagellar motor is a supramolecular protein machine that drives rotation of the flagellum for motility, which is essential for bacterial survival in different environments and a key determinant of pathogenicity. The detailed structure of the flagellar motor remains unknown. Here we present an atomic-resolution cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the bacterial flagellar motor complexed with the hook, consisting of 175 subunits with a molecular mass of approximately 6.3 MDa. The structure reveals that 10 peptides protruding from the MS ring with the FlgB and FliE subunits mediate torque transmission from the MS ring to the rod and overcome the symmetry mismatch between the rotational and helical structures in the motor. The LP ring contacts the distal rod and applies electrostatic forces to support its rotation and torque transmission to the hook. This work provides detailed molecular insights into the structure, assembly, and torque transmission mechanisms of the flagellar motor.",

    "abstract": "Glycoside hydrolases (GH) are a large family of hydrolytic enzymes found in all domains of life. As such, they control a plethora of normal and pathogenic biological functions. Thus, understanding selective inhibition of GH enzymes at the atomic level can lead to the identification of new classes of therapeutics. In these studies, we identified a 4-\u237a-glucoside of valienamine (8) as an inhibitor of Streptomyces coelicolor (Sco) GlgE1-V279S which belongs to the GH13 Carbohydrate Active EnZyme family. The results obtained from the dose-response experiments show that 8 at a concentration of 1000\u00a0\u00b5M reduced the enzyme activity of Sco GlgE1-V279S by 65%. The synthetic route to 8 and a closely related 4-\u237a-glucoside of validamine (7) was achieved starting from readily available D-maltose. A key step in the synthesis was a chelation-controlled addition of vinylmagnesium bromide to a maltose-derived enone intermediate. X-ray structures of both 7 and 8 in complex with Sco GlgE1-V279S were solved to resolutions of 1.75 and 1.83\u00a0\u00c5, respectively. Structural analysis revealed the valienamine derivative 8 binds the enzyme in an E<sub>2</sub> conformation for the cyclohexene fragment. Also, the cyclohexene fragment shows a new hydrogen-bonding contact from the pseudo-diaxial C(3)-OH to the catalytic nucleophile Asp 394 at the enzyme active site. Asp 394, in fact, forms a bidentate interaction with both the C(3)-OH and C(7)-OH of the inhibitor. In contrast, compound 7 disrupts the catalytic sidechain interaction network of Sco GlgE1-V279S via steric interactions resulting in a conformation change in Asp 394. These findings will have implications for the design other aminocarbasugar-based GH13-inhibitors and will be useful for identifying more potent and selective inhibitors.",

This enzyme is a promising antiviral target because catalytic mutations render viruses nonpathogenic. Here, we report a massive crystallographic screening and computational docking effort, identifying new chemical matter primarily targeting the active site of the macrodomain. Crystallographic screening of 2533 diverse fragments resulted in 214 unique macrodomain-binders. An additional 60 molecules were selected from docking more than 20 million fragments, of which 20 were crystallographically confirmed. X-ray data collection to ultra-high resolution and at physiological temperature enabled assessment of the conformational heterogeneity around the active site. Several fragment hits were confirmed by solution binding using three biophysical techniques (differential scanning fluorimetry, homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence, and isothermal titration calorimetry). The 234 fragment structures explore a wide range of chemotypes and provide starting points for development of potent SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Chloramphenicol (CHL) is a ribosome-targeting antibiotic that binds to the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of the bacterial ribosome and inhibits peptide bond formation. As an approach for modifying and potentially improving the properties of this inhibitor, we explored ribosome binding and inhibitory properties of a semi-synthetic triphenylphosphonium analog of CHL-CAM-C4-TPP. Our data demonstrate that this compound exhibits a ~5-fold stronger affinity for the bacterial ribosome and higher potency as an in vitro protein synthesis inhibitor compared to CHL. The X-ray crystal structure of the <i>Thermus thermophilus</i> 70S ribosome in complex with CAM-C4-TPP reveals that, while its amphenicol moiety binds at the PTC in a fashion identical to CHL, the C4-TPP tail adopts an extended propeller-like conformation within the ribosome exit tunnel where it establishes multiple hydrophobic Van der Waals interactions with the rRNA. The synthesized compound represents a promising chemical scaffold for further development by medicinal chemists because it simultaneously targets the two key functional centers of the bacterial ribosome-PTC and peptide exit tunnel.",

    "abstract": "Seeds of the root parasitic plant Striga hermonthica can sense very low concentrations of strigolactones (SLs) exuded from host roots. The S. hermonthica hyposensitive to light (ShHTL) proteins are putative SL receptors, among which ShHTL7 reportedly confers sensitivity to picomolar levels of SL when expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the molecular mechanism underlying ShHTL7 sensitivity is unknown. Here we determined the ShHTL7 crystal structure and quantified its interactions with various SLs and key interacting proteins. We established that ShHTL7 has an active-site pocket with broad-spectrum response to different SLs and moderate affinity. However, in contrast to other ShHTLs, we observed particularly high affinity of ShHTL7 for F-box protein AtMAX2. Furthermore, ShHTL7 interacted with AtMAX2 and with transcriptional regulator AtSMAX1 in response to nanomolar SL concentration. ShHTL7 mutagenesis analyses identified surface residues that contribute to its high-affinity binding to AtMAX2 and residues in the ligand binding pocket that confer broad-spectrum response to SLs with various structures. Crucially, yeast-three hybrid experiments showed that AtMAX2 confers responsiveness of the ShHTL7-AtSMAX1 interaction to picomolar levels of SL in line with the previously reported physiological sensitivity. These findings highlight the key role of SL-induced MAX2-ShHTL7-SMAX1 complex formation in determining the sensitivity to SL. Moreover, these data suggest a strategy to screen for compounds that could promote suicidal seed germination at physiologically relevant levels.",

    "abstract": "Proteins with sequence or structure similar to those of di-Zn exopeptidases are usually classified as the M28-family enzymes, including the mammalian-type glutaminyl cyclases (QCs). QC catalyzes protein N-terminal pyroglutamate formation, a posttranslational modification important under many physiological and pathological conditions, and is a drug target for treating neurodegenerative diseases, cancers and inflammatory disorders. Without functional characterization, mammalian QCs and their orthologs remain indistinguishable at the sequence and structure levels from other M28-family proteins, leading to few reported QCs. Here, we show that a low-barrier carboxylic-acid hydrogen-bond network (CAHBN) is required for QC activity and discriminates QCs from M28-family peptidases. We demonstrate that the CAHBN-containing M28 peptidases deposited in the PDB are indeed QCs. Our analyses identify several thousands of QCs from the three domains of life, and we enzymatically and structurally characterize several. For the first time, the interplay between a CAHBN and the binuclear metal-binding center of mammalian QCs is made clear. We found that the presence or absence of CAHBN is a key discriminator for the formation of either the mono-Zn QCs or the di-Zn exopeptidases. Our study helps explain the possible roles of QCs in life.",

A potent retinoid isomerase (RPE65) inhibitor, (<i>R</i>)-emixustat, has been developed and tested in several clinical trials; however, it has not received regulatory approval for use in any specific retinopathy. Rapid clearance of this drug presents challenges to maintaining concentrations in eyes within a therapeutic window. To address this pharmacokinetic inadequacy, we rationally designed and synthesized a series of emixustat derivatives with strategically placed fluorine and deuterium atoms to slow down the key metabolic transformations known for emixustat. Crystal structures and quantum chemical analysis of RPE65 in complex with the most potent emixustat derivatives revealed the structural and electronic bases for how fluoro substituents can be favorably accommodated within the active site pocket of RPE65. We found a close (\u223c3.0 \u00c5) F-\u03c0 interaction that is predicted to contribute \u223c2.4 kcal/mol to the overall binding energy.",

    "abstract": "Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are essential for plant biomass deconstruction. GH11 family consist of endo-\u03b2-1,4-xylanases which hydrolyze xylan, the second most abundant cell wall biopolymer after cellulose, into small bioavailable oligomers. Structural requirements for enzymatic mechanism of xylan hydrolysis is well described for GH11 members. However, over the last years, it has been discovered that some enzymes from GH11 family have a secondary binding sites (SBS), which modulate the enzymes activities, but mechanistic details of the molecular communication between the active site and SBS of the enzymes remain a conundrum. In the present work we structurally characterized GH11 xylanase from <i>Paenibacillus xylanivorans A57</i> (<i>Px</i>Xyn11B), a microorganism of agricultural importance, using protein crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations. The <i>Px</i>Xyn11B structure was solved to 2.5\u00a0\u00c5 resolution and different substrates (xylo-oligosaccharides from X3 to X6), were modelled in its active and SBS sites. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations revealed an important role of SBS in the activity and conformational mobility of <i>Px</i>Xyn11B, demonstrating that binding of the reaction products to the SBS of the enzyme stabilizes the N-terminal region and, consequently, the active site. Furthermore, MD simulations showed that the longer the ligand, the better is the stabilization within active site, and the positive subsites contribute less to the stabilization of the substrates than the negative ones. These findings provide rationale for the observed enzyme kinetics, shedding light on the conformational modulation of the GH11 enzymes via their SBS mediated by the positive molecular feedback loop which involve the products of the enzymatic reaction.",

    "abstract": "A challenge faced by peptidases is the recognition of highly diverse substrates. A feature of some peptidase families is the capacity to specifically use post-translationally added glycans present on their protein substrates as a recognition determinant. This is ultimately critical to enabling peptide bond hydrolysis. This class of enzyme is also frequently large and architecturally sophisticated. However, the molecular details underpinning glycan recognition by these <i>O</i>-glycopeptidases, the importance of these interactions, and the functional roles of their ancillary domains remain unclear. Here, using the <i>Clostridium perfringens</i> ZmpA, ZmpB, and ZmpC M60 peptidases as model proteins, we provide structural and functional insight into how these intricate proteins recognize glycans as part of catalytic and noncatalytic substrate recognition. Structural, kinetic, and mutagenic analyses support the key role of glycan recognition within the M60 domain catalytic site, though they point to ZmpA as an apparently inactive enzyme. Wider examination of the Zmp domain content reveals noncatalytic carbohydrate binding as a feature of these proteins. The complete three-dimensional structure of ZmpB provides rare insight into the overall molecular organization of a highly multimodular enzyme and reveals how the interplay of individual domain function may influence biological activity. <i>O</i>-glycopeptidases frequently occur in host-adapted microbes that inhabit or attack mucus layers. Therefore, we anticipate that these results will be fundamental to informing more detailed models of how the glycoproteins that are abundant in mucus are destroyed as part of pathogenic processes or liberated as energy sources during normal commensal lifestyles.",

    "abstract": "A number of plant-associated proteobacteria have LuxR family transcription factors that we refer to as PipR subfamily members. PipR proteins play roles in interactions between bacteria and their plant hosts, and some are important for bacterial virulence of plants. We identified an ethanolamine derivative, <i>N</i>-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-(2-hydroxyethylamino) acetamide (HEHEAA), as a potent effector of PipR-mediated gene regulation in the plant endophyte <i>Pseudomonas</i> GM79. HEHEAA-dependent PipR activity requires an ATP-binding cassette-type active transport system, and the periplasmic substrate-binding protein (SBP) of that system binds HEHEAA. To begin to understand the molecular basis of PipR system responses to plant factors we crystallized a HEHEAA-responsive SBP in the free- and HEHEAA-bound forms. The SBP, which is similar to peptide-binding SBPs, was in a closed conformation. A narrow cavity at the interface of its two lobes is wide enough to bind HEHEAA, but it cannot accommodate peptides with side chains. The polar atoms of HEHEAA are recognized by hydrogen-bonding interactions, and additional SBP residues contribute to the binding site. This binding mode was confirmed by a structure-based mutational analysis. We also show that a closely related SBP from the plant pathogen <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv <i>tomato</i> DC3000 does not recognize HEHEAA. However, a single amino acid substitution in the presumed effector-binding pocket of the <i>P. syringae</i> SBP converted it to a weak HEHEAA-binding protein. The <i>P. syringae</i> PipR depends on a plant effector for activity, and our findings imply that different PipR-associated SBPs bind different effectors.",

Among them, Phl p 1 and Phl p 5 are thought to be the most important, as a majority of timothy grass-allergic individuals have IgE antibodies directed against these two allergens. The profilin from timothy grass (Phl p 12) has been registered as a minor allergen, with up to 35% of individuals in populations of grass pollen allergic patients showing IgE binding to Phl p 12. Profilins are primarily minor allergens and are known for a high likelihood of co-sensitization as well as cross-reactivity situations caused by their sequence and structure similarity. The crystal structure of Phl p 12.0101 was determined and it revealed that this allergen may form an unusual dimer not previously observed among any profilins. For example, the Phl p 12 dimer has a completely different geometry and interface when compared with the latex profilin (Hev b 8) dimer that has its crystal structure determined. The structure of Phl p 12.0101 is described in the context of allergenic sensitization and allergy diagnostics. Moreover, the structure of the Phl p 12.0101 dimer is discussed, taking into account the production of recombinant allergens and their storage.",

    "abstract": "Arrival of the novel SARS-CoV-2 has launched a worldwide effort to identify both pre-approved and novel therapeutics targeting the viral proteome, highlighting the urgent need for efficient drug discovery strategies. Even with effective vaccines, infection is possible, and at-risk populations would benefit from effective drug compounds that reduce the lethality and lasting damage of COVID-19 infection. The CoV-2 MacroD-like macrodomain (Mac1) is implicated in viral pathogenicity by disrupting host innate immunity through its mono (ADP-ribosyl) hydrolase activity, making it a prime target for antiviral therapy. We therefore solved the structure of CoV-2 Mac1 from non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3) and applied structural and sequence-based genetic tracing, including newly determined A.\u00a0pompejana MacroD2 and GDAP2 amino acid sequences, to compare and contrast CoV-2 Mac1 with the functionally related human DNA-damage signaling factor poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG). Previously, identified targetable features of the PARG active site allowed us to develop a pharmacologically useful PARG inhibitor (PARGi). Here, we developed a focused chemical library and determined 6 novel PARGi X-ray crystal structures for comparative analysis. We applied this knowledge to discovery of CoV-2 Mac1 inhibitors by combining computation and structural analysis to identify PARGi fragments with potential to bind the distal-ribose and adenosyl pockets of the CoV-2 Mac1 active site. Scaffold development of these PARGi fragments has yielded two novel compounds, PARG-345 and PARG-329, that crystallize within the Mac1 active site, providing critical structure-activity data and a pathway for inhibitor optimization. The reported structural findings demonstrate ways to harness our PARGi synthesis and characterization pipeline to develop CoV-2 Mac1 inhibitors targeting the ADP-ribose active site. Together, these structural and computational analyses reveal a path for accelerating development of antiviral therapeutics from pre-existing drug optimization pipelines.",

The m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase METTL3 has been linked to the initiation and maintenance of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), but the potential of therapeutic applications targeting this enzyme remains unknown<sup>5-7</sup>. Here we present the identification and characterization of STM2457, a highly potent and selective first-in-class catalytic inhibitor of METTL3, and a crystal structure of STM2457 in complex with METTL3-METTL14. Treatment of tumours with STM2457 leads to reduced AML growth and an increase in differentiation and apoptosis. These cellular effects are accompanied by selective reduction of m<sup>6</sup>A levels on known leukaemogenic mRNAs and a decrease in their expression consistent with a translational defect. We demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of METTL3 in vivo leads to impaired engraftment and prolonged survival in various mouse models of AML, specifically targeting key stem cell subpopulations of AML. Collectively, these results reveal the inhibition of METTL3 as a potential therapeutic strategy against AML, and provide proof of concept that the targeting of RNA-modifying enzymes represents a promising avenue for anticancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "The heme enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) plays an essential role in immunity, neuronal function, and aging through catalysis of the rate-limiting step in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism. Many IDO1 inhibitors with different chemotypes have been developed, mainly targeted for use in anti-cancer immunotherapy. Lead optimization of direct heme iron-binding inhibitors has proven difficult due to the remarkable selectivity and sensitivity of the heme-ligand interactions. Here, we present experimental data for a set of closely related small azole compounds with more than 4 orders of magnitude differences in their inhibitory activities, ranging from millimolar to nanomolar levels. We investigate and rationalize their activities based on structural data, molecular dynamics simulations, and density functional theory calculations. Our results not only expand the presently known four confirmed chemotypes of sub-micromolar heme binding IDO1 inhibitors by two additional scaffolds but also provide a model to predict the activities of novel scaffolds.",

    "abstract": "Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor (TRAF) family members share a common domain architecture, but play non-redundant physiological roles in cell signalling. At the N terminus, most TRAFs have a RING domain, followed by a series of Zinc finger (ZF) domains. The RING domain of TRAF6 dimerizes, and the RING homodimer together with the first ZF assembles ubiquitin chains that form a platform which facilitates activation of downstream kinases. The RING dimer interface is conserved amongst TRAF proteins, suggesting that functional heterodimers could be possible. Here we report the structure of the TRAF5-TRAF6 RING heterodimer, which accounts for the stability of the heterodimer as well as its ability to assemble ubiquitin chains. We also show that the RING domain of TRAF6 heterodimerizes with TRAF3 and TRAF2, and demonstrate that the linker helix and first ZF of TRAF2 can cooperate with TRAF6 to promote chain assembly. Collectively our results suggest that TRAF RING homo- and hetero-dimers have the potential to bridge interaction of nearby TRAF trimers and modulate TRAF-mediated signalling.",

Crystal structures of Nsp15 from different coronaviruses have shown a common hexameric assembly, yet how the enzyme recognizes and processes RNA remains poorly understood. Here we report a series of cryo-EM reconstructions of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15, in both apo and UTP-bound states. The cryo-EM reconstructions, combined with biochemistry, mass spectrometry, and molecular dynamics, expose molecular details of how critical active site residues recognize uridine and facilitate catalysis of the phosphodiester bond. Mass spectrometry revealed the accumulation of cyclic phosphate cleavage products, while analysis of the apo and UTP-bound datasets revealed conformational dynamics not observed by crystal structures that are likely important to facilitate substrate recognition and regulate nuclease activity. Collectively, these findings advance understanding of how Nsp15 processes viral RNA and provide a structural framework for the development of new therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomes are the macromolecular machines at the heart of protein synthesis; however, their function can be modulated by a variety of additional protein factors that directly interact with them. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of human Ebp1 (p48 isoform) bound to the human 80S ribosome at 3.3 \u00c5 resolution. Ebp1 binds in the vicinity of the peptide exit tunnel on the 80S ribosome, and this binding is enhanced upon puromycin-mediated translational inhibition. The association of Ebp1 with the 80S ribosome centers around its interaction with ribosomal proteins eL19 and uL23 and the 28S rRNA. Further analysis of the Ebp1-ribosome complex suggests that Ebp1 can rotate around its insert domain, which may enable it to assume a wide range of conformations while maintaining its interaction with the ribosome. Structurally, Ebp1 shares homology with the methionine aminopeptidase 2 family of enzymes; therefore, this inherent flexibility may also be conserved.",

    "abstract": "Vinculin and its heart-specific splice variant metavinculin are key regulators of cell adhesion processes. These membrane-bound cytoskeletal proteins regulate the cell shape by binding to several other proteins at cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions. Vinculin and metavinculin link integrin adhesion molecules to the filamentous actin network. Loss of both proteins prevents cell adhesion and cell spreading and reduces the formation of stress fibers, focal adhesions, or lamellipodia extensions. The binding of talin at cell-matrix junctions or of \u03b1-catenin at cell-cell junctions activates vinculin and metavinculin by releasing their autoinhibitory head-tail interaction. Once activated, vinculin and metavinculin bind F-actin via their five-helix bundle tail domains. Unlike vinculin, metavinculin has a 68-amino-acid insertion before the second \u03b1-helix of this five-helix F-actin-binding domain. Here, we present the full-length cryogenic electron microscopy structure of metavinculin that captures the dynamics of its individual domains and unveiled a hallmark structural feature, namely a kinked isoform-specific \u03b1-helix in its F-actin-binding domain. Our identified conformational landscape of metavinculin suggests a structural priming mechanism that is consistent with the cell adhesion functions of metavinculin in response to mechanical and cellular cues. Our findings expand our understanding of metavinculin function in the heart with implications for the etiologies of cardiomyopathies.",

    "abstract": "Many proteins are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum by the universally conserved Sec61 channel. Post-translational transport requires two additional proteins, Sec62 and Sec63, but their functions are poorly defined. In the present study, we determined cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of several variants of Sec61-Sec62-Sec63 complexes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Thermomyces lanuginosus and show that Sec62 and Sec63 induce opening of the Sec61 channel. Without Sec62, the translocation pore of Sec61 remains closed by the plug domain, rendering the channel inactive. We further show that the lateral gate of Sec61 must first be partially opened by interactions between Sec61 and Sec63 in cytosolic and luminal domains, a simultaneous disruption of which completely closes the channel. The structures and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that Sec62 may also prevent lipids from invading the channel through the open lateral gate. Our study shows how Sec63 and Sec62 work together in a hierarchical manner to activate Sec61 for post-translational protein translocation.",

    "abstract": "Human adenovirus species D (HAdV-D) types are currently being explored as vaccine vectors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other severe infectious diseases. The efficacy of such vector-based vaccines depends on functional interactions with receptors on host cells. Adenoviruses of different species are assumed to enter host cells mainly by interactions between the knob domain of the protruding fiber capsid protein and cellular receptors. Using a cell-based receptor-screening assay, we identified CD46 as a receptor for HAdV-D56. The function of CD46 was validated in infection experiments using cells lacking and overexpressing CD46, and by competition infection experiments using soluble CD46. Remarkably, unlike HAdV-B types that engage CD46 through interactions with the knob domain of the fiber protein, HAdV-D types infect host cells through a direct interaction between CD46 and the hexon protein. Soluble hexon proteins (but not fiber knob) inhibited HAdV-D56 infection, and surface plasmon analyses demonstrated that CD46 binds to HAdV-D hexon (but not fiber knob) proteins. Cryoelectron microscopy analysis of the HAdV-D56 virion-CD46 complex confirmed the interaction and showed that CD46 binds to the central cavity of hexon trimers. Finally, soluble CD46 inhibited infection by 16 out of 17 investigated HAdV-D types, suggesting that CD46 is an important receptor for a large group of adenoviruses. In conclusion, this study identifies a noncanonical entry mechanism used by human adenoviruses, which adds to the knowledge of adenovirus biology and can also be useful for development of adenovirus-based vaccine vectors.",

    "abstract": "The pathogens Vibrio cholerae and Haemophilus influenzae use tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic transporters (TRAPs) to scavenge sialic acid from host tissues. They use it as a nutrient or to evade the innate immune system by sialylating surface lipopolysaccharides. An essential component of TRAP transporters is a periplasmic substrate binding protein (SBP). Without substrate, the SBP has been proposed to rest in an open-state, which is not recognised by the transporter. Substrate binding induces a conformational change of the SBP and it is thought that this closed state is recognised by the transporter, triggering substrate translocation. Here we use real time single molecule FRET experiments and crystallography to investigate the open- to closed-state transition of VcSiaP, the SBP of the sialic acid TRAP transporter from V. cholerae. We show that the conformational switching of VcSiaP is strictly substrate induced, confirming an important aspect of the proposed transport mechanism. Two new crystal structures of VcSiaP provide insights into the closing mechanism. While the first structure contains the natural ligand, sialic acid, the second structure contains an artificial peptide in the sialic acid binding site. Together, the two structures suggest that the ligand itself stabilises the closed state and that SBP closure is triggered by physically bridging the gap between the two lobes of the SBP. Finally, we demonstrate that the affinity for the artificial peptide substrate can be substantially increased by varying its amino acid sequence and by this, serve as a starting point for the development of peptide-based inhibitors of TRAP transporters.",

    "abstract": "The function of the origin recognition complex (ORC) in DNA replication is highly conserved in recognizing and marking the initiation sites. The detailed molecular mechanisms by which human ORC is reconfigured into a state competent for origin association remain largely unknown. Here, we present structural characterizations of human ORC1-5 and ORC2-5 assemblies. ORC2-5 exhibits a tightly autoinhibited conformation with the winged-helix domain of ORC2 completely blocking the central DNA-binding channel. The binding of ORC1 partially relieves the autoinhibitory effect of ORC2-5 through remodeling ORC2-WHD, which makes ORC2-WHD away from the central channel creating a still autoinhibited but more dynamic structure. In particular, the AAA+ domain of ORC1 is highly flexible to sample a variety of conformations from inactive to potentially active states. These results provide insights into the detailed mechanisms regulating the autoinhibition of human ORC and its subsequent activation for DNA binding.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic ribosomes consist of a small 40S and a large 60S subunit that are assembled in a highly coordinated manner. More than 200 factors ensure correct modification, processing and folding of ribosomal RNA and the timely incorporation of ribosomal proteins<sup>1,2</sup>. Small subunit maturation ends in the cytosol, when the final rRNA precursor, 18S-E, is cleaved at site 3 by the endonuclease NOB1<sup>3</sup>. Previous structures of human 40S precursors have shown that NOB1 is kept in an inactive state by its partner PNO1<sup>4</sup>. The final maturation events, including the activation of NOB1 for the decisive rRNA-cleavage step and the mechanisms driving the dissociation of the\u00a0last biogenesis factors have, however, remained unresolved. Here we report five cryo-electron microscopy structures of human 40S subunit precursors, which describe the compositional and conformational progression during the final steps of 40S assembly. Our structures explain the central role of RIOK1 in the displacement and dissociation of PNO1, which in turn allows conformational changes and activation of the endonuclease NOB1. In addition, we observe two factors, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A domain-containing protein (EIF1AD) and leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 47 (LRRC47), which bind to late pre-40S particles near RIOK1 and the central rRNA helix 44. Finally, functional data shows that EIF1AD is required for efficient assembly factor recycling and 18S-E processing. Our results thus enable a detailed understanding of the last steps in 40S formation in human cells and, in addition, provide evidence for principal differences in small ribosomal subunit formation between humans and the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 spike employs mobile receptor-binding domains (RBDs) to engage the human ACE2 receptor and to facilitate virus entry, which can occur through low-pH-endosomal pathways. To understand how ACE2 binding and low pH affect spike conformation, we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures-at serological and endosomal pH-delineating spike recognition of up to three ACE2 molecules. RBDs freely adopted \"up\" conformations required for ACE2 interaction, primarily through RBD movement combined with smaller alterations in neighboring domains. In the absence of ACE2, single-RBD-up conformations dominated at pH 5.5, resolving into a solitary all-down conformation at lower pH. Notably, a pH-dependent refolding region (residues 824-858) at the spike-interdomain interface displayed dramatic structural rearrangements and mediated RBD positioning through coordinated movements of the entire trimer apex. These structures provide a foundation for understanding prefusion-spike mechanics governing endosomal entry; we suggest that the low pH all-down conformation potentially facilitates immune evasion from RBD-up binding antibody.",

    "abstract": "Protein nanocages represent a class of nanovehicles for a variety of applications. However, precise manipulation of self-assembly behavior of these protein nanocages in response to multiple external stimuli for custom-tailored applications remains challenging. Herein, we established a simple but effective strategy for controlling protein nanocage self-assembly that combines a dual property of His motifs (their significantly pH-dependent protonation state and their capacity to coordinate with transition metals) with its high symmetry. With this strategy, we enabled two different ferritin nanocages to disassemble into protein tetramers under neutral solution by introducing His<sub>6</sub> motifs at the 4-fold channel interfaces. Notably, these tetramers are able to self-assemble into ferritin-like protein nanocages in response to multiple external stimuli such as transition metal ions and pH, and <i>vice versa</i>, indicative of a reversible self-assembly process. Furthermore, such His-mediated reversible protein self-assembly has been explored for encapsulation of bioactive cargo molecules within these reconstituted protein nanocages with higher loading efficiency under milder conditions as compared to the reported acid denaturation encapsulation method for ferritin.",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus enters host cells via an interaction between its Spike protein and the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). By screening a yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic nanobody sequences, we developed nanobodies that disrupt the interaction between Spike and ACE2. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that one nanobody, Nb6, binds Spike in a fully inactive conformation with its receptor binding domains locked into their inaccessible down state, incapable of binding ACE2. Affinity maturation and structure-guided design of multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody, mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for Spike and picomolar neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection. mNb6-tri retains function after aerosolization, lyophilization, and heat treatment, which enables aerosol-mediated delivery of this potent neutralizer directly to the airway epithelia.",

However, traditional antibody production is hampered by long development times and costly production. Here, we report the rapid isolation and characterization of nanobodies from a synthetic library, known as sybodies (Sb), that target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Several binders with low nanomolar affinities and efficient neutralization activity were identified of which Sb23 displayed high affinity and neutralized pseudovirus with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.6\u2009\u00b5g/ml. A cryo-EM structure of the spike bound to Sb23 showed that Sb23 binds competitively in the ACE2 binding site. Furthermore, the cryo-EM reconstruction revealed an unusual conformation of the spike where two RBDs are in the 'up' ACE2-binding conformation. The combined approach represents an alternative, fast workflow to select binders with neutralizing activity against newly emerging viruses.",

    "abstract": "Adhesion G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a major family of GPCRs, but limited knowledge of their ligand regulation or structure is available<sup>1-3</sup>. Here we report that glucocorticoid stress hormones activate adhesion G-protein-coupled receptor G3 (ADGRG3; also known as GPR97)<sup>4-6</sup>, a prototypical adhesion GPCR. The cryo-electron microscopy structures of GPR97-G<sub>o</sub> complexes bound to the anti-inflammatory drug beclomethasone or the steroid hormone cortisol revealed that glucocorticoids bind to a pocket within the transmembrane domain. The steroidal core of glucocorticoids is packed against the 'toggle switch' residue W<sup>6.53</sup>, which senses the binding of a ligand and induces activation of the receptor. Active GPR97 uses a quaternary core and HLY motif to fasten the seven-transmembrane bundle and to mediate G protein coupling. The cytoplasmic side of GPR97 has an open cavity, where all three intracellular loops interact with the G<sub>o</sub> protein, contributing to the high basal activity of GRP97. Palmitoylation at the cytosolic tail of the G<sub>o</sub> protein was found to be essential for efficient engagement with GPR97 but is not observed in other solved GPCR complex structures. Our work provides a structural basis for ligand binding to the seven-transmembrane domain of an adhesion GPCR and subsequent G protein coupling.",

    "abstract": "Desmosomes are cell-cell junctions that link tissue cells experiencing intense mechanical stress. Although the structure of the desmosomal cadherins is known, the desmosome architecture-which is essential for mediating numerous functions-remains elusive. Here, we recorded cryo-electron tomograms (cryo-ET) in which individual cadherins can be discerned; they appear variable in shape, spacing, and tilt with respect to the membrane. The resulting sub-tomogram average reaches a resolution of \u223c26 \u00c5, limited by the inherent flexibility of desmosomes. To address this challenge typical of dynamic biological assemblies, we combine sub-tomogram averaging with atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We generate models of possible cadherin arrangements and perform an in silico screening according to biophysical and structural properties extracted from MD simulation trajectories. We find a truss-like arrangement of cadherins that resembles the characteristic footprint seen in the electron micrograph. The resulting model of the desmosomal architecture explains their unique biophysical properties and strength.",

    "abstract": "Advances in genomic analyses enable the identification of new proteins that are associated with disease. To validate these targets, tool molecules are required to demonstrate that a ligand can have a disease-modifying effect. Currently, as tools are reported for only a fraction of the proteome, platforms for ligand discovery are essential to leverage insights from genomic analyses. Fragment screening offers an efficient approach to explore chemical space. Presented here is a fragment-screening platform, termed PhABits (PhotoAffinity Bits), which utilizes a library of photoreactive fragments to covalently capture fragment-protein interactions. Hits can be profiled to determine potency and the site of crosslinking, and subsequently developed as reporters in a competitive displacement assay to identify novel hit matter. The PhABit platform is envisioned to be widely applicable to novel protein targets, identifying starting points in the development of therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of the specificity and kinetics of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for understanding immune protection and identifying targets for vaccine design. In a cohort of 647 SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects, we found that both the magnitude of Ab responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleoprotein and nAb titers correlate with clinical scores. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) is immunodominant and the target of 90% of the neutralizing activity present in SARS-CoV-2 immune sera. Whereas overall RBD-specific serum IgG titers waned with a half-life of 49\u00a0days, nAb titers and avidity increased over time for some individuals, consistent with affinity maturation. We structurally defined an RBD antigenic map and serologically quantified serum Abs specific for distinct RBD epitopes leading to the identification of two major receptor-binding motif antigenic sites. Our results explain the immunodominance of the receptor-binding motif and will guide the design of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Diffraction (X-ray, neutron and electron) and electron cryo-microscopy are powerful methods to determine three-dimensional macromolecular structures, which are required to understand biological processes and to develop new therapeutics against diseases. The overall structure-solution workflow is similar for these techniques, but nuances exist because the properties of the reduced experimental data are different. Software tools for structure determination should therefore be tailored for each method. Phenix is a comprehensive software package for macromolecular structure determination that handles data from any of these techniques. Tasks performed with Phenix include data-quality assessment, map improvement, model building, the validation/rebuilding/refinement cycle and deposition. Each tool caters to the type of experimental data. The design of Phenix emphasizes the automation of procedures, where possible, to minimize repetitive and time-consuming manual tasks, while default parameters are chosen to encourage best practice. A graphical user interface provides access to many command-line features of Phenix and streamlines the transition between programs, project tracking and re-running of previous tasks.",

    "abstract": "Prevailing dogma holds that ribosomes are uniform in composition and function. Here, we show that nutrient limitation-induced stress in E.\u00a0coli changes the relative expression of rDNA operons to alter the rRNA composition within the actively translating ribosome pool. The most upregulated operon encodes the unique 16S rRNA, rrsH, distinguished by conserved sequence variation within the small ribosomal subunit. rrsH-bearing ribosomes affect the expression of functionally coherent gene sets and alter the levels of the RpoS sigma factor, the master regulator of the general stress response. These impacts are associated with phenotypic changes in antibiotic sensitivity, biofilm formation, and cell motility and are regulated by stress response proteins, RelA and RelE, as well as the metabolic enzyme and virulence-associated protein, AdhE. These findings establish that endogenously encoded, naturally occurring rRNA sequence variation can modulate ribosome function, central aspects of gene expression regulation, and cellular physiology.",

    "abstract": "Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) systems are prokaryotic adaptive immune systems against invading nucleic acids. CRISPR locus variability has been exploited in evolutionary and epidemiological studies of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, for over 20 yr, yet the biological function of this type III-A system is largely unexplored. Here, using cell biology and biochemical, mutagenic, and RNA-seq approaches, we show it is active in invader defense and has features atypical of type III-A systems: mature CRISPR RNA (crRNA) in its crRNA-CRISPR/Cas protein complex are of uniform length (\u223c71 nt) and appear not to be subject to 3'-end processing after Cas6 cleavage of repeat RNA 8 nt from its 3' end. crRNAs generated resemble mature crRNA in type I systems, having both 5' (8 nt) and 3' (28 nt) repeat tags. Cas6 cleavage of repeat RNA is ion dependent, and accurate cleavage depends on the presence of a 3' hairpin in the repeat RNA and the sequence of its stem base nucleotides. This study unveils further diversity among CRISPR/Cas systems and provides insight into the crRNA recognition mechanism in M. tuberculosis, providing a foundation for investigating the potential of a type III-A-based genome editing system.-Wei, W., Zhang, S., Fleming, J., Chen, Y., Li, Z., Fan, S., Liu, Y., Wang, W., Wang, T., Liu, Y., Ren, B., Wang, M., Jiao, J., Chen, Y., Zhou, Y., Zhou, Y., Gu, S., Zhang, X., Wan, L., Chen, T., Zhou, L., Chen, Y., Zhang, X.-E., Li, C., Zhang, H., Bi, L.

The use of a simplified refinement target function enables very fast calculation, which in turn makes it possible to identify optimal data-restraint weights as part of routine refinements with little runtime cost. Refinement of atomic models against low-resolution data benefits from the inclusion of as much additional information as is available. In addition to standard restraints on covalent geometry, phenix.real_space_refine makes use of extra information such as secondary-structure and rotamer-specific restraints, as well as restraints or constraints on internal molecular symmetry. The re-refinement of 385 cryo-EM-derived models available in the Protein Data Bank at resolutions of 6\u2005\u00c5 or better shows significant improvement of the models and of the fit of these models to the target maps.",

Despite extensive studies spanning five decades, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying subunit assembly and conformational transition are still unclear due to the lack of high-resolution structural information. Here, we report the atomic structure of a type I MTase complex (2M+1S) bound to DNA and cofactor S-adenosyl methionine in the \"open\" form. The intermolecular interactions between M and S subunits are mediated by a four-helix bundle motif, which also determines the specificity of the interaction. Structural comparison between open and previously reported low-resolution \"closed\" structures identifies the huge conformational changes within the MTase complex. Furthermore, biochemical results show that R subunits prefer to load onto the closed form MTase. Based on our results, we proposed an updated model for the complex assembly. The work reported here provides guidelines for future applications in molecular biology.",

C-Glycosides are remarkably stable, as their C-C bonds are resistant to glycosidase or acid hydrolysis. A variety of plant species are known to accumulate C-glycosylflavonoids; however, the genes encoding for enzymes that catalyze C-glycosylation of flavonoids have been identified only from Oryza sativa (rice) and Zea mays (maize), and have not been identified from dicot plants. In this study, we identified the C-glucosyltransferase gene from the dicot plant Fagopyrum esculentum\u00a0M. (buckwheat). We purified two isozymes from buckwheat seedlings that catalyze C-glucosylation of 2-hydroxyflavanones, which are expressed specifically in the cotyledon during seed germination. Following purification we isolated the cDNA corresponding to each isozyme [FeCGTa (UGT708C1) and FeCGTb (UGT708C2)]. When expressed in Escherichia coli, both proteins demonstrated C-glucosylation activity towards 2-hydroxyflavanones, dihydrochalcone, trihydroxyacetophenones and other related compounds with chemical structures similar to 2',4',6'-trihydroxyacetophenone. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of plant glycosyltransferases shows that flavonoid C-glycosyltransferases form a different clade with other functionally analyzed plant glycosyltransferases.",

X-ray or neutron diffraction data can be used separately or jointly in refinement. phenix.refine is tightly integrated into the PHENIX suite, where it serves as a critical component in automated model building, final structure refinement, structure validation and deposition to the wwPDB. This paper presents an overview of the major phenix.refine features, with extensive literature references for readers interested in more detailed discussions of the methods.",

The program displays electron-density maps and atomic models and allows model manipulations such as idealization, real-space refinement, manual rotation/translation, rigid-body fitting, ligand search, solvation, mutations, rotamers and Ramachandran idealization. Furthermore, tools are provided for model validation as well as interfaces to external programs for refinement, validation and graphics. The software is designed to be easy to learn for novice users, which is achieved by ensuring that tools for common tasks are 'discoverable' through familiar user-interface elements (menus and toolbars) or by intuitive behaviour (mouse controls). Recent developments have focused on providing tools for expert users, with customisable key bindings, extensions and an extensive scripting interface. The software is under rapid development, but has already achieved very widespread use within the crystallographic community. The current state of the software is presented, with a description of the facilities available and of some of the underlying methods employed.",

    "abstract": "<h4>Background</h4>Escherichia coli strains adhere to the normally sterile human uroepithelium using type 1 pili, that are long, hairy surface organelles exposing a mannose-binding FimH adhesin at the tip. A small percentage of adhered bacteria can successfully invade bladder cells, presumably via pathways mediated by the high-mannosylated uroplakin-Ia and alpha3beta1 integrins found throughout the uroepithelium. Invaded bacteria replicate and mature into dense, biofilm-like inclusions in preparation of fluxing and of infection of neighbouring cells, being the major cause of the troublesome recurrent urinary tract infections.<h4>Methodology/principal findings</h4>We demonstrate that alpha-D-mannose based inhibitors of FimH not only block bacterial adhesion on uroepithelial cells but also antagonize invasion and biofilm formation. Heptyl alpha-D-mannose prevents binding of type 1-piliated E. coli to the human bladder cell line 5637 and reduces both adhesion and invasion of the UTI89 cystitis isolate instilled in mouse bladder via catheterization. Heptyl alpha-D-mannose also specifically inhibited biofilm formation at micromolar concentrations. The structural basis of the great inhibitory potential of alkyl and aryl alpha-D-mannosides was elucidated in the crystal structure of the FimH receptor-binding domain in complex with oligomannose-3. FimH interacts with Man alpha1,3Man beta1,4GlcNAc beta1,4GlcNAc in an extended binding site. The interactions along the alpha1,3 glycosidic bond and the first beta1,4 linkage to the chitobiose unit are conserved with those of FimH with butyl alpha-D-mannose. The strong stacking of the central mannose with the aromatic ring of Tyr48 is congruent with the high affinity found for synthetic inhibitors in which this mannose is substituted for by an aromatic group.<h4>Conclusions/significance</h4>The potential of ligand-based design of antagonists of urinary tract infections is ruled by the structural mimicry of natural epitopes and extends into blocking of bacterial invasion, intracellular growth and capacity to fluxing and of recurrence of the infection.",

The novel phasing algorithms implemented in Phaser have been developed using maximum likelihood and multivariate statistics. For molecular replacement, the new algorithms have proved to be significantly better than traditional methods in discriminating correct solutions from noise, and for single-wavelength anomalous dispersion experimental phasing, the new algorithms, which account for correlations between F(+) and F(-), give better phases (lower mean phase error with respect to the phases given by the refined structure) than those that use mean F and anomalous differences DeltaF. One of the design concepts of Phaser was that it be capable of a high degree of automation. To this end, Phaser (written in C++) can be called directly from Python, although it can also be called using traditional CCP4 keyword-style input. Phaser is a platform for future development of improved phasing methods and their release, including source code, to the crystallographic community.",

Initial testing of the HKL-3000 system (the beta version was named HKL-2000_ph) with more than 140 novel structure determinations has proven its high value for MAD/SAD experiments. The heuristics for choosing the best computational strategy at different data resolution limits of phasing signal and crystal diffraction are being optimized. The typical end result is an interpretable electron-density map with a partially built structure and, in some cases, an almost complete refined model. The current development is oriented towards very fast structure solution in order to provide feedback during the diffraction experiment. Work is also proceeding towards improving the quality of phasing calculation and model building.",

Moreover, STR1 initiates all biosynthetic pathways leading to the entire monoterpenoid indole alkaloid family representing an enormous structural variety of approximately 2000 compounds in higher plants. The crystal structures of STR1 in complex with its natural substrates tryptamine and secologanin provide structural understanding of the observed substrate preference and identify residues lining the active site surface that contact the substrates. STR1 catalyzes a Pictet-Spengler-type reaction and represents a novel six-bladed beta-propeller fold in plant proteins. Structure-based sequence alignment revealed a common repetitive sequence motif (three hydrophobic residues are followed by a small residue and a hydrophilic residue), indicating a possible evolutionary relationship between STR1 and several sequence-unrelated six-bladed beta-propeller structures. Structural analysis and site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrate the essential role of Glu-309 in catalysis. The data will aid in deciphering the details of the reaction mechanism of STR1 as well as other members of this enzyme family.",
